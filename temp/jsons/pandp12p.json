    "Pride and Prejudice\nby Jane Austen\nChapter 1\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in posses-\nsion of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.",
    "However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be\non his ﬁrst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well ﬁxed in the\nminds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.",
    "“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you\nheard that Netherﬁeld Park is let at last?”\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.",
    "“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\ntold me all about it.”\nMr. Bennet made no answer.",
    "“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impa-\ntiently.",
    "“Youwant to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\nThis was invitation enough.",
    "“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherﬁeld is\ntaken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that\nhe came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and\nwas so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris imme-\ndiately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of\nhis servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”\n“What is his name?”\n“Bingley.”\n“Is he married or single?”\n“Oh!",
    "Single, my dear, to be sure!",
    "A single man of large fortune;\nfour or ﬁve thousand a year.",
    "What a ﬁne thing for our girls!”\n“How so?",
    "How can it affect them?”\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tire-\nsome!",
    "You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\n1\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\n“Design!",
    "Nonsense, how can you talk so!",
    "But it is very likely that\nhemayfall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him\nas soon as he comes.”\n“I see no occasion for that.",
    "You and the girls may go, or you may\nsend them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you\nare as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of\nthe party.”\n“My dear, you ﬂatter me.",
    "I certainly have had my share of beauty,\nbut I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.",
    "When a woman\nhas ﬁve grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her\nown beauty.”\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\ncomes into the neighbourhood.”\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\n“But consider your daughters.",
    "Only think what an establishment it\nwould be for one of them.",
    "Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined\nto go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\nnewcomers.",
    "Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for usto visit\nhim if you do not.”\n“You are over-scrupulous, surely.",
    "I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\nvery glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him\nof my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls;\nthough I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\n“I desire you will do no such thing.",
    "Lizzy is not a bit better than\nthe others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half\nso good-humoured as Lydia.",
    "But you are always giving herthe prefer-\nence.”\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;\n“they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something\nmore of quickness than her sisters.”\n“Mr.",
    "Bennet, how canyou abuse your own children in such a way?",
    "You take delight in vexing me.",
    "You have no compassion for my poor\nnerves.”\n“You mistake me, my dear.",
    "I have a high respect for your nerves.",
    "They are my old friends.",
    "I have heard you mention them with consid-\neration these last twenty years at least.”\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of\nfour thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\n2\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will\nnot visit them.”\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit\nthem all.”\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\nbeen insufﬁcient to make his wife understand his character.",
    "Hermind\nwas less difﬁcult to develop.",
    "She was a woman of mean understand-\ning, little information, and uncertain temper.",
    "When she was discon-\ntented, she fancied herself nervous.",
    "The business of her life was to get\nher daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.",
    "Chapter 2\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bin-\ngley.",
    "He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always\nassuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the\nvisit was paid she had no knowledge of it.",
    "It was then disclosed in the\nfollowing manner.",
    "Observing his second daughter employed in trim-\nming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\n“We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said her\nmother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\n“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him\nat the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”\n“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.",
    "She has two\nnieces of her own.",
    "She is a selﬁsh, hypocritical woman, and I have no\nopinion of her.”\n“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to ﬁnd that you\ndo not depend on her serving you.”\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.",
    "“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake!",
    "Have a little\ncompassion on my nerves.",
    "You tear them to pieces.”\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\nthem ill.”\n“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.",
    "“When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\n“To-morrow fortnight.”\n“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come\n3\nback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce\nhim, for she will not know him herself.”\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to her.”\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\nwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?”\n“I honour your circumspection.",
    "A fortnight’s acquaintance is cer-\ntainly very little.",
    "One cannot know what a man really is by the end of\na fortnight.",
    "But if wedo not venture somebody else will; and after all,\nMrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore,\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the ofﬁce, I will\ntake it on myself.”\nThe girls stared at their father.",
    "Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\nnonsense!”\n“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.",
    "“Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid\non them, as nonsense?",
    "I cannot quite agree with you there.",
    "What say\nyou, Mary?",
    "For you are a young lady of deep reﬂection, I know, and\nread great books and make extracts.”\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.",
    "“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to\nMr. Bingley.”\n“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.",
    "“I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before?",
    "If I\nhad known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on\nhim.",
    "It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot\nescape the acquaintance now.”\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\nMrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the ﬁrst tumult\nof joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected\nall the while.",
    "“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!",
    "But I knew I should\npersuade you at last.",
    "I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect\nsuch an acquaintance.",
    "Well, how pleased I am!",
    "and it is such a good\njoke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a\nword about it till now.”\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Ben-\nnet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his\nwife.",
    "“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door\nwas shut.",
    "“I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his\n4\nkindness; or me, either, for that matter.",
    "At our time of life it is not so\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\nfor your sakes, we would do anything.",
    "Lydia, my love, though you are\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\nball.”\n“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I amthe\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\nwould return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should\nask him to dinner.",
    "Chapter 3\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her ﬁve\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufﬁcient to draw from her\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.",
    "They attacked\nhim in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious supposi-\ntions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and\nthey were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their\nneighbour, Lady Lucas.",
    "Her report was highly favourable.",
    "Sir William\nhad been delighted with him.",
    "He was quite young, wonderfully hand-\nsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at\nthe next assembly with a large party.",
    "Nothing could be more delight-\nful!",
    "To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\nand very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.",
    "“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Nether-\nﬁeld,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally\nwell married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about\nten minutes with him in his library.",
    "He had entertained hopes of being\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\nmuch; but he saw only the father.",
    "The ladies were somewhat more\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper\nwindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.",
    "An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and al-\nready had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.",
    "Mr. Bing-\nley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, un-\nable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.",
    "Mrs. Bennet was quite\ndisconcerted.",
    "She could not imagine what business he could have in\n5\ntown so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear\nthat he might be always ﬂying about from one place to another, and\nnever settled at Netherﬁeld as he ought to be.",
    "Lady Lucas quieted her\nfears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\nget a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bin-\ngley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the\nassembly.",
    "The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were\ncomforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he\nbrought only six with him from London—his ﬁve sisters and a cousin.",
    "And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only\nﬁve altogether—Mr.",
    "Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest,\nand another young man.",
    "Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleas-\nant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.",
    "His sisters were ﬁne\nwomen, with an air of decided fashion.",
    "His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst,\nmerely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the\nattention of the room by his ﬁne, tall person, handsome features, no-\nble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within ﬁve\nminutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.",
    "The gen-\ntlemen pronounced him to be a ﬁne ﬁgure of a man, the ladies declared\nhe was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with\ngreat admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a dis-\ngust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to\nbe proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not\nall his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a\nmost forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\ncompared with his friend.",
    "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the princi-\npal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every\ndance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\nhimself at Netherﬁeld.",
    "Such amiable qualities must speak for them-\nselves.",
    "What a contrast between him and his friend!",
    "Mr. Darcy danced\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walk-\ning about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.",
    "His\ncharacter was decided.",
    "He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\nin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\nagain.",
    "Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose\ndislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resent-\nment by his having slighted one of her daughters.",
    "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to\n6\nsit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had\nbeen standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him\nand Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press\nhis friend to join it.",
    "“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance.",
    "I hate to see you\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner.",
    "You had much better\ndance.”\n“I certainly shall not.",
    "You know how I detest it, unless I am par-\nticularly acquainted with my partner.",
    "At such an assembly as this it\nwould be insupportable.",
    "Your sisters are engaged, and there is not an-\nother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me\nto stand up with.”\n“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a\nkingdom!",
    "Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls\nin my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\nuncommonly pretty.”\n“Youare dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said\nMr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.",
    "“Oh!",
    "She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!",
    "But there is\none of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and\nI dare say very agreeable.",
    "Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”\n“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment\nat Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\n“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no hu-\nmour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\nby other men.",
    "You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”\nMr. Bingley followed his advice.",
    "Mr. Darcy walked off; and Eliza-\nbeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.",
    "She told the\nstory, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.",
    "The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole fam-\nily.",
    "Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\nNetherﬁeld party.",
    "Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had\nbeen distinguished by his sisters.",
    "Jane was as much gratiﬁed by this\nas her mother could be, though in a quieter way.",
    "Elizabeth felt Jane’s\npleasure.",
    "Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the\nmost accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Ly-\ndia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which\nwas all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.",
    "They returned,\ntherefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived,\n7\nand of which they were the principal inhabitants.",
    "They found Mr. Ben-\nnet still up.",
    "With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\noccasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening\nwhich had raised such splendid expectations.",
    "He had rather hoped\nthat his wife’s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he\nsoon found out that he had a different story to hear.",
    "“Oh!",
    "my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had\na most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.",
    "I wish you had been\nthere.",
    "Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.",
    "Everybody said\nhow well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and\ndanced with her twice!",
    "Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced\nwith her twice!",
    "and she was the only creature in the room that he asked\na second time.",
    "First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.",
    "I was so vexed to see\nhim stand up with her!",
    "But, however, he did not admire her at all;\nindeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane\nas she was going down the dance.",
    "So he inquired who she was, and\ngot introduced, and asked her for the two next.",
    "Then the two third\nhe danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and\nthe two ﬁfth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\nBoulanger —”\n“If he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband impa-\ntiently, “he would not have danced half so much!",
    "For God’s sake, say\nno more of his partners.",
    "O that he had sprained his ankle in the ﬁrst\nplace!”\n“Oh!",
    "my dear, I am quite delighted with him.",
    "He is so excessively\nhandsome!",
    "And his sisters are charming women.",
    "I never in my life\nsaw anything more elegant than their dresses.",
    "I dare say the lace upon\nMrs. Hurst’s gown—”\nHere she was interrupted again.",
    "Mr. Bennet protested against any\ndescription of ﬁnery.",
    "She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.",
    "“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much\nby not suiting hisfancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not\nat all worth pleasing.",
    "So high and so conceited that there was no en-\nduring him!",
    "He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so\nvery great!",
    "Not handsome enough to dance with!",
    "I wish you had been\nthere, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.",
    "I quite detest\nthe man.”\n8\nChapter 4\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just\nhow very much she admired him.",
    "“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so\nmuch ease, with such perfect good breeding!”\n“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\nought likewise to be, if he possibly can.",
    "His character is thereby com-\nplete.”\n“I was very much ﬂattered by his asking me to dance a second time.",
    "I did not expect such a compliment.”\n“Did not you?",
    "I did for you.",
    "But that is one great difference between\nus.",
    "Compliments always take youby surprise, and menever.",
    "What\ncould be more natural than his asking you again?",
    "He could not help\nseeing that you were about ﬁve times as pretty as every other woman\nin the room.",
    "No thanks to his gallantry for that.",
    "Well, he certainly is\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.",
    "You have liked many\na stupider person.”\n“Dear Lizzy!”\n“Oh!",
    "you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in gen-\neral.",
    "You never see a fault in anybody.",
    "All the world are good and\nagreeable in your eyes.",
    "I never heard you speak ill of a human being\nin your life.”\n“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\nspeak what I think.”\n“I know you do; and it is thatwhich makes the wonder.",
    "With your\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!",
    "Affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it every-\nwhere.",
    "But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the\ngood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\nof the bad—belongs to you alone.",
    "And so you like this man’s sisters,\ntoo, do you?",
    "Their manners are not equal to his.”\n“Certainly not—at ﬁrst.",
    "But they are very pleasing women when\nyou converse with them.",
    "Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and\nkeep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not ﬁnd a very\ncharming neighbour in her.”\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behav-\niour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and\nwith more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her\n9\nsister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself,\nshe was very little disposed to approve them.",
    "They were in fact very\nﬁne ladies; not deﬁcient in good humour when they were pleased, nor\nin the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but\nproud and conceited.",
    "They were rather handsome, had been educated\nin one of the ﬁrst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty\nthousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought,\nand of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every re-\nspect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.",
    "They\nwere of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance\nmore deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother’s for-\ntune and their own had been acquired by trade.",
    "Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\nestate, but did not live to do it.",
    "Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\nsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided\nwith a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many\nof those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might\nnot spend the remainder of his days at Netherﬁeld, and leave the next\ngeneration to purchase.",
    "His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by\nno means unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs. Hurst, who\nhad married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to con-\nsider his house as her home when it suited her.",
    "Mr. Bingley had not\nbeen of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recom-\nmendation to look at Netherﬁeld House.",
    "He did look at it, and into\nit for half-an-hour—was pleased with the situation and the principal\nrooms, satisﬁed with what the owner said in its praise, and took it im-\nmediately.",
    "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite\nof great opposition of character.",
    "Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\nnever appeared dissatisﬁed.",
    "On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bing-\nley had the ﬁrmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.",
    "In understanding, Darcy was the superior.",
    "Bingley was by no means\ndeﬁcient, but Darcy was clever.",
    "He was at the same time haughty, re-\nserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not\ninviting.",
    "In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.",
    "Bingley\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\n10\ngiving offense.",
    "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was suf-\nﬁciently characteristic.",
    "Bingley had never met with more pleasant peo-\nple or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and at-\ntentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon\nfelt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not\nconceive an angel more beautiful.",
    "Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a\ncollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\nnone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\neither attention or pleasure.",
    "Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\nbut she smiled too much.",
    "Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they ad-\nmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and\none whom they would not object to know more of.",
    "Miss Bennet was\ntherefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized\nby such commendation to think of her as he chose.",
    "Chapter 5\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the\nBennets were particularly intimate.",
    "Sir William Lucas had been for-\nmerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and\nrisen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during\nhis mayoralty.",
    "The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.",
    "It\nhad given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small\nmarket town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his\nfamily to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that\nperiod Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own\nimportance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in be-\ning civil to all the world.",
    "For, though elated by his rank, it did not\nrender him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every-\nbody.",
    "By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at\nSt. James’s had made him courteous.",
    "Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.",
    "They had several children.",
    "The el-\ndest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,\nwas Elizabeth’s intimate friend.",
    "That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk\nover a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assem-\nbly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.",
    "11\n“Youbegan the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil\nself-command to Miss Lucas.",
    "“ Youwere Mr. Bingley’s ﬁrst choice.”\n“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\n“Oh!",
    "you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.",
    "To be sure that didseem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he\ndid—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something\nabout Mr. Robinson.”\n“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robin-\nson; did not I mention it to you?",
    "Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he\nliked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were\na great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the pret-\ntiest?",
    "and his answering immediately to the last question: ‘Oh!",
    "the\neldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on\nthat point.’ ”\n“Upon my word!",
    "Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem\nas if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\n“Myoverhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza,” said\nCharlotte.",
    "“Mr.",
    "Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is\nhe?—poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable .”\n“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite\na misfortune to be liked by him.",
    "Mrs. Long told me last night that he\nsat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”\n“Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said\nJane.",
    "“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\n“Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherﬁeld, and\nhe could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry\nat being spoke to.”\n“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much, un-\nless among his intimate acquaintances.",
    "With them he is remarkably\nagreeable.”\n“I do not believe a word of it, my dear.",
    "If he had been so very\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.",
    "But I can guess how\nit was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he\nhad heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had\ncome to the ball in a hack chaise.”\n“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but\nI wish he had danced with Eliza.”\n“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with\nhim, if I were you.”\n“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you never to dance with\n12\nhim.”\n“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend meso much as pride\noften does, because there is an excuse for it.",
    "One cannot wonder that so\nvery ﬁne a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\nshould think highly of himself.",
    "If I may so express it, he has a right to\nbe proud.”\n“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\nhispride, if he had not mortiﬁed mine.”\n“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of\nher reﬂections, “is a very common failing, I believe.",
    "By all that I have\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who\ndo not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some qual-\nity or other, real or imaginary.",
    "Vanity and pride are different things,\nthough the words are often used synonymously.",
    "A person may be\nproud without being vain.",
    "Pride relates more to our opinion of our-\nselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\n“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came\nwith his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was.",
    "I would keep a\npack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”\n“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said\nMrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your\nbottle directly.”\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that\nshe would, and the argument ended only with the visit.",
    "Chapter 6\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherﬁeld.",
    "The\nvisit was soon returned in due form.",
    "Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners\ngrew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the\nmother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth\nspeaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed\ntowards the two eldest.",
    "By Jane, this attention was received with the\ngreatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treat-\nment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like\nthem; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as aris-\ning in all probability from the inﬂuence of their brother’s admiration.",
    "It was generally evident whenever they met, that he didadmire her\nand to herit was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the prefer-\n13\nence which she had begun to entertain for him from the ﬁrst, and was\nin a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure\nthat it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since\nJane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and\na uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the\nsuspicions of the impertinent.",
    "She mentioned this to her friend Miss\nLucas.",
    "“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to im-\npose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to\nbe so very guarded.",
    "If a woman conceals her affection with the same\nskill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of ﬁxing him;\nand it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally\nin the dark.",
    "There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.",
    "We can all begin\nfreely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of\nus who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.",
    "In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than\nshe feels.",
    "Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do\nmore than like her, if she does not help him on.”\n“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.",
    "If I\ncan perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to\ndiscover it too.”\n“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you\ndo.”\n“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\nconceal it, he must ﬁnd it out.”\n“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.",
    "But, though Bingley\nand Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and,\nas they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible\nthat every moment should be employed in conversing together.",
    "Jane\nshould therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can\ncommand his attention.",
    "When she is secure of him, there will be more\nleisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.”\n“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\nquestion but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.",
    "But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design.",
    "As yet,\nshe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its\nreasonableness.",
    "She has known him only a fortnight.",
    "She danced four\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own\nhouse, and has since dined with him in company four times.",
    "This is\n14\nnot quite enough to make her understand his character.”\n“Not as you represent it.",
    "Had she merely dined with him, she might\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\nremember that four evenings have also been spent together—and four\nevenings may do a great deal.”\n“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they\nboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\n“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and\nif she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good\na chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for\na twelvemonth.",
    "Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.",
    "If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other\nor ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\nleast.",
    "They always continue to grow sufﬁciently unlike afterwards to\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible\nof the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”\n“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.",
    "You know it is\nnot sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Eliza-\nbeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of\nsome interest in the eyes of his friend.",
    "Mr. Darcy had at ﬁrst scarcely al-\nlowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.",
    "But no\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\nhad a good feature in her face, than he began to ﬁnd it was rendered\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.",
    "To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.",
    "Though\nhe had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect sym-\nmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her ﬁgure to be light\nand pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not\nthose of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playful-\nness.",
    "Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man\nwho made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her\nhandsome enough to dance with.",
    "He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards con-\nversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.",
    "His\ndoing so drew her notice.",
    "It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large\nparty were assembled.",
    "“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening\nto my conversation with Colonel Forster?”\n15\n“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\n“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\nwhat he is about.",
    "He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seem-\ning to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas deﬁed her friend to\nmention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth\nto do it, she turned to him and said:\n“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\nwell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\nMeryton?”\n“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\nenergetic.”\n“You are severe on us.”\n“It will be herturn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas.",
    "“I am going\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\n“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always want-\ning me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!",
    "If my vanity\nhad taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it\nis, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the\nhabit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persever-\ning, however, she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And\ngravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a ﬁne old saying, which every-\nbody here is of course familiar with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your\nporridge’; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.”\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.",
    "After\na song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several\nthat she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument\nby her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain\none in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments,\nwas always impatient for display.",
    "Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\nher application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than\nshe had reached.",
    "Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to\nwith much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary,\nat the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude\nby Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\nwith some of the Lucases, and two or three ofﬁcers, joined eagerly in\ndancing at one end of the room.",
    "Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\n16\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\nmuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was\nhis neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\n“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!",
    "There is nothing like dancing after all.",
    "I consider it as one of the ﬁrst\nreﬁnements of polished society.”\n“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\namongst the less polished societies of the world.",
    "Every savage can\ndance.”\nSir William only smiled.",
    "“Your friend performs delightfully,” he\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”\n“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\n“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\nsight.",
    "Do you often dance at St. James’s?”\n“Never, sir.”\n“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\n“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\n“You have a house in town, I conclude?”\nMr. Darcy bowed.",
    "“I had once had some thought of ﬁxing in town myself—for I am\nfond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not dis-\nposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them,\nhe was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called\nout to her:\n“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?",
    "Mr. Darcy, you\nmust allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable\npartner.",
    "You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty\nis before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.\nDarcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive\nit, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to\nSir William:\n“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.",
    "I entreat you\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the hon-\nour of her hand, but in vain.",
    "Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir\nWilliam at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.",
    "“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny\nme the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\n17\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige\nus for one half-hour.”\n“Mr.",
    "Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.",
    "“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\nEliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance—for who would object\nto such a partner?”\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away.",
    "Her resistance had not\ninjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\n“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\n“I should imagine not.”\n“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\nevenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of\nyour opinion.",
    "I was never more annoyed!",
    "The insipidity, and yet the\nnoise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people!",
    "What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\n“You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.",
    "My mind was more\nagreeably engaged.",
    "I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\nwhich a pair of ﬁne eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\nMiss Bingley immediately ﬁxed her eyes on his face, and desired\nhe would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reﬂections.",
    "Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley.",
    "“I am all astonish-\nment.",
    "How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray, when am I\nto wish you joy?”\n“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.",
    "A lady’s\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\nto matrimony, in a moment.",
    "I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\n“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is ab-\nsolutely settled.",
    "You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;\nand, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to en-\ntertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that\nall was safe, her wit ﬂowed long.",
    "Chapter 7\nMr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\n18\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s for-\ntune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the\ndeﬁciency of his.",
    "Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had\nleft her four thousand pounds.",
    "She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to\ntheir father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.",
    "The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and\nto a milliner’s shop just over the way.",
    "The two youngest of the fam-\nily, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morn-\ning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare\nof news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\nsome from their aunt.",
    "At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\nwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\nthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton\nwas the headquarters.",
    "Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most inter-\nesting intelligence.",
    "Every day added something to their knowledge of\nthe ofﬁcers’ names and connections.",
    "Their lodgings were not long a\nsecret, and at length they began to know the ofﬁcers themselves.",
    "Mr.\nPhillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felic-\nity unknown before.",
    "They could talk of nothing but ofﬁcers; and Mr.\nBingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals\nof an ensign.",
    "After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\nBennet coolly observed:\n“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be\ntwo of the silliest girls in the country.",
    "I have suspected it some time,\nbut I am now convinced.”\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with\nperfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain\nCarter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was\ngoing the next morning to London.",
    "“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be\nso ready to think your own children silly.",
    "If I wished to think slight-\ningly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”\n19\n“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”\n“Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\n“This is the only point, I ﬂatter myself, on which we do not agree.",
    "I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I\nmust so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters\nuncommonly foolish.”\n“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the\nsense of their father and mother.",
    "When they get to our age, I dare say\nthey will not think about ofﬁcers any more than we do.",
    "I remember the\ntime when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still\nat my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with ﬁve or six thousand a\nyear, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I\nthought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir\nWilliam’s in his regimentals.”\n“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\nCaptain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when\nthey ﬁrst came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s li-\nbrary.”\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman\nwith a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherﬁeld, and the servant\nwaited for an answer.",
    "Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and\nshe was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\n“Well, Jane, who is it from?",
    "What is it about?",
    "What does he say?",
    "Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\n“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.",
    "“My dear friend ,—\n“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\nme, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,\nfor a whole day’s t ˆete-`a-tˆete between two women can never end with-\nout a quarrel.",
    "Come as soon as you can on receipt of this.",
    "My brother\nand the gentlemen are to dine with the ofﬁcers.—Yours ever,\n“Caroline Bingley ”\n“With the ofﬁcers!” cried Lydia.",
    "“I wonder my aunt did not tell us\nofthat.”\n“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”\n“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.",
    "“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\nlikely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”\n20\n“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure\nthat they would not offer to send her home.”\n“Oh!",
    "but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to\nMeryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\n“I had much rather go in the coach.”\n“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.",
    "They\nare wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”\n“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\n“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s\npurpose will be answered.”\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the\nhorses were engaged.",
    "Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback,\nand her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognos-\ntics of a bad day.",
    "Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone\nlong before it rained hard.",
    "Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her\nmother was delighted.",
    "The rain continued the whole evening without\nintermission; Jane certainly could not come back.",
    "“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more\nthan once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.",
    "Till the\nnext morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her con-\ntrivance.",
    "Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherﬁeld\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:\n“My dearest Lizzy ,—\n“I ﬁnd myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\nimputed to my getting wet through yesterday.",
    "My kind friends will not\nhear of my returning till I am better.",
    "They insist also on my seeing Mr.\nJones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having\nbeen to me—and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not\nmuch the matter with me.—Yours, etc.”\n“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\naloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous ﬁt of illness—if she\nshould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\n“Oh!",
    "I am not afraid of her dying.",
    "People do not die of little triﬂing\ncolds.",
    "She will be taken good care of.",
    "As long as she stays there, it is\nall very well.",
    "I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\nthough the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman,\nwalking was her only alternative.",
    "She declared her resolution.",
    "21\n“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\nthing, in all this dirt!",
    "You will not be ﬁt to be seen when you get there.”\n“I shall be very ﬁt to see Jane—which is all I want.”\n“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?”\n“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk.",
    "The distance is noth-\ning when one has a motive; only three miles.",
    "I shall be back by dinner.”\n“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but\nevery impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opin-\nion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”\n“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.",
    "Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\ntogether.",
    "“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we\nmay see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings\nof one of the ofﬁcers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone,\ncrossing ﬁeld after ﬁeld at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and spring-\ning over puddles with impatient activity, and ﬁnding herself at last\nwithin view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a\nface glowing with the warmth of exercise.",
    "She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.",
    "That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in con-\ntempt for it.",
    "She was received, however, very politely by them; and\nin their brother’s manners there was something better than politeness;\nthere was good humour and kindness.",
    "Mr. Darcy said very little, and\nMr. Hurst nothing at all.",
    "The former was divided between admira-\ntion of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and\ndoubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone.",
    "The latter\nwas thinking only of his breakfast.",
    "Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.",
    "Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not\nwell enough to leave her room.",
    "Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giv-\ning alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much\nshe longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.",
    "She was\nnot equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left\nthem together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for\nthe extraordinary kindness she was treated with.",
    "Elizabeth silently at-\n22\ntended her.",
    "When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Eliza-\nbeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\nsolicitude they showed for Jane.",
    "The apothecary came, and having ex-\namined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught\na violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.",
    "The\nadvice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and\nher head ached acutely.",
    "Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment;\nnor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they\nhad, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.",
    "When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\nvery unwillingly said so.",
    "Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and\nshe only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testiﬁed such\nconcern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert\nthe offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherﬁeld for the\npresent.",
    "Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dis-\npatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring\nback a supply of clothes.",
    "Chapter 8\nAt ﬁve o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner.",
    "To the civil inquiries which then\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing\nthe much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a\nvery favourable answer.",
    "Jane was by no means better.",
    "The sisters, on\nhearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved,\nhow shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they\ndisliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter:\nand their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them\nrestored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.",
    "Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\ncould regard with any complacency.",
    "His anxiety for Jane was evident,\nand his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her\nfeeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered\nby the others.",
    "She had very little notice from any but him.",
    "Miss Bing-\nley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for\nMr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived\nonly to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer\n23\na plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.",
    "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bin-\ngley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.",
    "Her man-\nners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and\nimpertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty.",
    "Mrs. Hurst\nthought the same, and added:\n“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excel-\nlent walker.",
    "I shall never forget her appearance this morning.",
    "She re-\nally looked almost wild.”\n“She did, indeed, Louisa.",
    "I could hardly keep my countenance.",
    "Very nonsensical to come at all!",
    "Why must shebe scampering about the\ncountry, because her sister had a cold?",
    "Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”\n“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\ndeep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been\nlet down to hide it not doing its ofﬁce.”\n“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this\nwas all lost upon me.",
    "I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remark-\nably well when she came into the room this morning.",
    "Her dirty petti-\ncoat quite escaped my notice.”\n“Youobserved it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I\nam inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make\nsuch an exhibition.”\n“Certainly not.”\n“To walk three miles, or four miles, or ﬁve miles, or whatever it\nis, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!",
    "What could she\nmean by it?",
    "It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited\nindependence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.”\n“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bin-\ngley.",
    "“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper,\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her ﬁne\neyes.”\n“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\n“I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\nsweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.",
    "But with\nsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there\nis no chance of it.”\n“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on\nMeryton.”\n24\n“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheap-\nside.”\n“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.",
    "“If they had uncles enough to ﬁll allCheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”\n“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of\nany consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.",
    "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\ntheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.",
    "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room\non leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to cof-\nfee.",
    "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all,\ntill late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep,\nand when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should\ngo downstairs herself.",
    "On entering the drawing-room she found the\nwhole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but sus-\npecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister\nthe excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could\nstay below, with a book.",
    "Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.",
    "“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\n“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards.",
    "She is a\ngreat reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\n“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\namnota great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\n“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley;\n“and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards\nthe table where a few books were lying.",
    "He immediately offered to\nfetch her others—all that his library afforded.",
    "“And I wish my collection were larger for your beneﬁt and my own\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\nthan I ever looked into.”\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\nthose in the room.",
    "“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have\nleft so small a collection of books.",
    "What a delightful library you have\nat Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\n“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many\ngenerations.”\n“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always\n25\nbuying books.”\n“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\nas these.”\n“Neglect!",
    "I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties\nof that noble place.",
    "Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may\nbe half as delightful as Pemberley.”\n“I wish it may.”\n“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neigh-\nbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.",
    "There is not a ﬁner\ncounty in England than Derbyshire.”\n“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”\n“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\n“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her\nvery little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she\ndrew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley\nand his eldest sister, to observe the game.",
    "“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley;\n“will she be as tall as I am?”\n“I think she will.",
    "She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height,\nor rather taller.”\n“How I long to see her again!",
    "I never met with anybody who de-\nlighted me so much.",
    "Such a countenance, such manners!",
    "And so ex-\ntremely accomplished for her age!",
    "Her performance on the pianoforte\nis exquisite.”\n“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have\npatience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\n“All young ladies accomplished!",
    "My dear Charles, what do you\nmean?”\n“Yes, all of them, I think.",
    "They all paint tables, cover screens, and\nnet purses.",
    "I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am\nsure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the ﬁrst time, without\nbeing informed that she was very accomplished.”\n“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy,\n“has too much truth.",
    "The word is applied to many a woman who de-\nserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen.",
    "But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies\nin general.",
    "I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the\nwhole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”\n“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.",
    "26\n“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in\nyour idea of an accomplished woman.”\n“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\n“Oh!",
    "certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usu-\nally met with.",
    "A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music,\nsinging, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the\nword; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her\nair and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and ex-\npressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.”\n“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must\nyet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind\nby extensive reading.”\n“I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished\nwomen.",
    "I rather wonder now at your knowing any.”\n“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility\nof all this?”\n“I never saw such a woman.",
    "I never saw such capacity, and taste,\nand application, and elegance, as you describe united.”\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\nof her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many\nwomen who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them\nto order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going\nforward.",
    "As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon\nafterwards left the room.",
    "“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on\nher, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves\nto the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare\nsay, it succeeds.",
    "But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean\nart.”\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chieﬂy\naddressed, “there is a meanness in allthe arts which ladies sometimes\ncondescend to employ for captivation.",
    "Whatever bears afﬁnity to cun-\nning is despicable.”\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisﬁed with this reply as to con-\ntinue the subject.",
    "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse,\nand that she could not leave her.",
    "Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\neminent physicians.",
    "This she would not hear of; but she was not so\n27\nunwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\nwere not decidedly better.",
    "Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\ndeclared that they were miserable.",
    "They solaced their wretchedness,\nhowever, by duets after supper, while he could ﬁnd no better relief\nto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\nattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.",
    "Chapter 9\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in\nthe morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer\nto the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a\nhousemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who\nwaited on his sisters.",
    "In spite of this amendment, however, she re-\nquested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit\nJane, and form her own judgement of her situation.",
    "The note was im-\nmediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.",
    "Mrs.\nBennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherﬁeld\nsoon after the family breakfast.",
    "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would\nhave been very miserable; but being satisﬁed on seeing her that her\nillness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering imme-\ndiately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from\nNetherﬁeld.",
    "She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s pro-\nposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived\nabout the same time, think it at all advisable.",
    "After sitting a little while\nwith Jane, on Miss Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and\nthree daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.",
    "Bingley met\nthem with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse\nthan she expected.",
    "“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer.",
    "“She is a great deal too ill to\nbe moved.",
    "Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.",
    "We must\ntrespass a little longer on your kindness.”\n“Removed!” cried Bingley.",
    "“It must not be thought of.",
    "My sister, I\nam sure, will not hear of her removal.”\n“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold\ncivility, “that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while\nshe remains with us.”\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.",
    "28\n“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers\na vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\ntemper I have ever met with.",
    "I often tell my other girls they are noth-\ning to her.",
    "You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming\nprospect over the gravel walk.",
    "I do not know a place in the country\nthat is equal to Netherﬁeld.",
    "You will not think of quitting it in a hurry,\nI hope, though you have but a short lease.”\n“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if\nI should resolve to quit Netherﬁeld, I should probably be off in ﬁve\nminutes.",
    "At present, however, I consider myself as quite ﬁxed here.”\n“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Eliza-\nbeth.",
    "“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards\nher.",
    "“Oh!",
    "yes—I understand you perfectly.”\n“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\nthrough I am afraid is pitiful.”\n“That is as it happens.",
    "It does not follow that a deep, intricate char-\nacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\n“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not\nrun on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\n“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you\nwere a studier of character.",
    "It must be an amusing study.”\n“Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing.",
    "They have at\nleast that advantage.”\n“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few sub-\njects for such a study.",
    "In a country neighbourhood you move in a very\nconﬁned and unvarying society.”\n“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new\nto be observed in them for ever.”\n“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of men-\ntioning a country neighbourhood.",
    "“I assure you there is quite as much\nofthatgoing on in the country as in town.”\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a mo-\nment, turned silently away.",
    "Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained\na complete victory over him, continued her triumph.",
    "“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country,\nfor my part, except the shops and public places.",
    "The country is a vast\ndeal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”\n29\n“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same.",
    "They have each\ntheir advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\n“Aye—that is because you have the right disposition.",
    "But that gen-\ntleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\nat all.”\n“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for\nher mother.",
    "“You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.",
    "He only meant that there\nwas not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the\ntown, which you must acknowledge to be true.”\n“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\nwith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neigh-\nbourhoods larger.",
    "I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\ncountenance.",
    "His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes to-\nwards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.",
    "Elizabeth, for the sake\nof saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked\nher if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since hercoming away.",
    "“Yes, she called yesterday with her father.",
    "What an agreeable man\nSir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?",
    "So much the man of fashion!",
    "So\ngenteel and easy!",
    "He had always something to say to everybody.",
    "That\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves\nvery important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the mat-\nter.”\n“Did Charlotte dine with you?”\n“No, she would go home.",
    "I fancy she was wanted about the mince-\npies.",
    "For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their\nown work; mydaughters are brought up very differently.",
    "But every-\nbody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of\ngirls, I assure you.",
    "It is a pity they are not handsome!",
    "Not that I think\nCharlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend.”\n“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”\n“Oh!",
    "dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.",
    "Lady Lucas\nherself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty.",
    "I do not like\nto boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often\nsee anybody better looking.",
    "It is what everybody says.",
    "I do not trust\nmy own partiality.",
    "When she was only ﬁfteen, there was a man at my\nbrother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-\nlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.",
    "But,\nhowever, he did not.",
    "Perhaps he thought her too young.",
    "However, he\nwrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”\n30\n“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently.",
    "“There\nhas been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.",
    "I wonder\nwho ﬁrst discovered the efﬁcacy of poetry in driving away love!”\n“I have been used to consider poetry as the foodof love,” said Darcy.",
    "“Of a ﬁne, stout, healthy love it may.",
    "Everything nourishes what is\nstrong already.",
    "But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am\nconvinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\nElizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.",
    "She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a\nshort silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley\nfor his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with\nLizzy.",
    "Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced\nhis younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.",
    "She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.\nBennet was satisﬁed, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.",
    "Upon\nthis signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.",
    "The two\ngirls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the\nresult of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having\npromised on his ﬁrst coming into the country to give a ball at Nether-\nﬁeld.",
    "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of ﬁfteen, with a ﬁne complexion\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\naffection had brought her into public at an early age.",
    "She had high ani-\nmal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention\nof the ofﬁcers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners, and her own easy\nmanners recommended her, had increased into assurance.",
    "She was\nvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball,\nand abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\nthe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.",
    "His answer\nto this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:\n“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\nwhen your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very\nday of the ball.",
    "But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”\nLydia declared herself satisﬁed.",
    "“Oh!",
    "yes—it would be much better\nto wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\nwould be at Meryton again.",
    "And when you have given your ball,” she\nadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also.",
    "I shall tell Colonel Forster\nit will be quite a shame if he does not.”\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth re-\nturned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour\n31\nto the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom,\nhowever, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in\nspite of all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on ﬁne eyes .",
    "Chapter 10\nThe day passed much as the day before had done.",
    "Mrs. Hurst and\nMiss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid,\nwho continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth\njoined their party in the drawing-room.",
    "The loo-table, however, did\nnot appear.",
    "Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him,\nwas watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his\nattention by messages to his sister.",
    "Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at\npiquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.",
    "Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufﬁciently amused\nin attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.",
    "The\nperpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on\nthe evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the per-\nfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious\ndialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.",
    "“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\nHe made no answer.",
    "“You write uncommonly fast.”\n“You are mistaken.",
    "I write rather slowly.”\n“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course\nof a year!",
    "Letters of business, too!",
    "How odious I should think them!”\n“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”\n“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\n“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\n“I am afraid you do not like your pen.",
    "Let me mend it for you.",
    "I\nmend pens remarkably well.”\n“Thank you—but I always mend my own.”\n“How can you contrive to write so even?”\nHe was silent.",
    "“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the\nharp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beau-\ntiful little design for a table, and I think it inﬁnitely superior to Miss\nGrantley’s.”\n“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?",
    "At\npresent I have not room to do them justice.”\n32\n“Oh!",
    "it is of no consequence.",
    "I shall see her in January.",
    "But do you\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”\n“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for\nme to determine.”\n“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\nease, cannot write ill.”\n“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her\nbrother, “because he does notwrite with ease.",
    "He studies too much for\nwords of four syllables.",
    "Do not you, Darcy?”\n“My style of writing is very different from yours.”\n“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way\nimaginable.",
    "He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”\n“My ideas ﬂow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—\nby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my\ncorrespondents.”\n“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm re-\nproof.”\n“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\nhumility.",
    "It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\nindirect boast.”\n“And which of the two do you call mylittle recent piece of mod-\nesty?”\n“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\nthink at least highly interesting.",
    "The power of doing anything with\nquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often with-\nout any attention to the imperfection of the performance.",
    "When you\ntold Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting\nNetherﬁeld you should be gone in ﬁve minutes, you meant it to be a\nsort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so\nvery laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary busi-\nness undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone\nelse?”\n“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all\nthe foolish things that were said in the morning.",
    "And yet, upon my\nhonour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\nmoment.",
    "At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”\n“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\nyou would be gone with such celerity.",
    "Your conduct would be quite as\n33\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better\nstay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would probably\nnot go—and at another word, might stay a month.”\n“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley\ndid not do justice to his own disposition.",
    "You have shown him off now\nmuch more than he did himself.”\n“I am exceedingly gratiﬁed,” said Bingley, “by your converting\nwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.",
    "But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by\nno means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under\nsuch a circumstance I were to give a ﬂat denial, and ride off as fast as I\ncould.”\n“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original in-\ntentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\n“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must\nspeak for himself.”\n“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call\nmine, but which I have never acknowledged.",
    "Allowing the case, how-\never, to stand according to your representation, you must remember,\nMiss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the\nhouse, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without\noffering one argument in favour of its propriety.”\n“To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit\nwith you.”\n“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understand-\ning of either.”\n“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the inﬂuence of\nfriendship and affection.",
    "A regard for the requester would often make\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to rea-\nson one into it.",
    "I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you\nhave supposed about Mr. Bingley.",
    "We may as well wait, perhaps, till\nthe circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behav-\niour thereupon.",
    "But in general and ordinary cases between friend and\nfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolu-\ntion of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for\ncomplying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\n“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is\nto appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\nbetween the parties?”\n34\n“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.",
    "I as-\nsure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison\nwith myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.",
    "I declare I\ndo not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions,\nand in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday\nevening, when he has nothing to do.”\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he\nwas rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.",
    "Miss Bingley\nwarmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation\nwith her brother for talking such nonsense.",
    "“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend.",
    "“You dislike an argu-\nment, and want to silence this.”\n“Perhaps I do.",
    "Arguments are too much like disputes.",
    "If you and\nMiss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\n“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacriﬁce on my side; and Mr.\nDarcy had much better ﬁnish his letter.”\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did ﬁnish his letter.",
    "When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Eliza-\nbeth for an indulgence of some music.",
    "Miss Bingley moved with some\nalacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth\nwould lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly\nnegatived, she seated herself.",
    "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus em-\nployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some\nmusic-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s\neyes were ﬁxed on her.",
    "She hardly knew how to suppose that she\ncould be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he\nshould look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.",
    "She\ncould only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because\nthere was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his\nideas of right, than in any other person present.",
    "The supposition did\nnot pain her.",
    "She liked him too little to care for his approbation.",
    "After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\nby a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\nElizabeth, said to her:\n“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\nopportunity of dancing a reel?”\nShe smiled, but made no answer.",
    "He repeated the question, with\n35\nsome surprise at her silence.",
    "“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately\ndetermine what to say in reply.",
    "You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person\nof their premeditated contempt.",
    "I have, therefore, made up my mind\nto tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise\nme if you dare.”\n“Indeed I do not dare.”\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\nmanner which made it difﬁcult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy\nhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.",
    "He\nreally believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections,\nhe should be in some danger.",
    "Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assis-\ntance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.",
    "She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talk-\ning of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an\nalliance.",
    "“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery\nthe next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\nand if you can compass it, do sure the younger girls of running after of-\nﬁcers.",
    "And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check\nthat little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which\nyour lady possesses.”\n“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”\n“Oh!",
    "yes.",
    "Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.",
    "Put them next to your great-uncle\nthe judge.",
    "They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\nlines.",
    "As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, for\nwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”\n“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably ﬁne, might be\ncopied.”\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst\nand Elizabeth herself.",
    "“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in\nsome confusion, lest they had been overheard.",
    "36\n“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running\naway without telling us that you were coming out.”\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\nto walk by herself.",
    "The path just admitted three.",
    "Mr. Darcy felt their\nrudeness, and immediately said:\n“This walk is not wide enough for our party.",
    "We had better go into\nthe avenue.”\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\nthem, laughingly answered:\n“No, no; stay where you are.",
    "You are charmingly grouped, and\nappear to uncommon advantage.",
    "The picturesque would be spoilt by\nadmitting a fourth.",
    "Good-bye.”\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\nbeing at home again in a day or two.",
    "Jane was already so much recov-\nered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.",
    "Chapter 11\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,\nand seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-\nroom, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many pro-\nfessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\nas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen ap-\npeared.",
    "Their powers of conversation were considerable.",
    "They could\ndescribe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with hu-\nmour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.",
    "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the ﬁrst object;\nMiss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps.",
    "He ad-\ndressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\nalso made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuse-\nness and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation.",
    "He was full of joy\nand attention.",
    "The ﬁrst half-hour was spent in piling up the ﬁre, lest\nshe should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his\ndesire to the other side of the ﬁreplace, that she might be further from\nthe door.",
    "He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.",
    "Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.",
    "When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\ncard-table—but in vain.",
    "She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\nDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\n37\npetition rejected.",
    "She assured him that no one intended to play, and\nthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.",
    "Mr.\nHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\nsofas and go to sleep.",
    "Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\nrings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\nBennet.",
    "Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\nMr. Darcy’s progress through hisbook, as in reading her own; and she\nwas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.",
    "She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely an-\nswered her question, and read on.",
    "At length, quite exhausted by the\nattempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen\nbecause it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and\nsaid, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!",
    "I declare af-\nter all there is no enjoyment like reading!",
    "How much sooner one tires\nof anything than of a book!",
    "When I have a house of my own, I shall be\nmiserable if I have not an excellent library.”\nNo one made any reply.",
    "She then yawned again, threw aside her\nbook, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement;\nwhen hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned\nsuddenly towards him and said:\n“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance\nat Netherﬁeld?",
    "I would advise you, before you determine on it, to\nconsult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there\nare not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment\nthan a pleasure.”\n“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\nchooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing;\nand as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send\nround my cards.”\n“I should like balls inﬁnitely better,” she replied, “if they were car-\nried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably te-\ndious in the usual process of such a meeting.",
    "It would surely be much\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order\nof the day.”\n“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not\nbe near so much like a ball.”\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and\nwalked about the room.",
    "Her ﬁgure was elegant, and she walked well;\nbut Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inﬂexibly studious.",
    "In\n38\nthe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,\nturning to Elizabeth, said:\n“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,\nand take a turn about the room.",
    "I assure you it is very refreshing after\nsitting so long in one attitude.”\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.",
    "Miss Bingley\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.",
    "He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.",
    "He was\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and\ndown the room together, with either of which motives his joining them\nwould interfere.",
    "“What could he mean?",
    "She was dying to know what\ncould be his meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all\nunderstand him?",
    "“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be\nsevere on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\nnothing about it.”\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy\nin anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of\nhis two motives.",
    "“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as\nsoon as she allowed him to speak.",
    "“You either choose this method of\npassing the evening because you are in each other’s conﬁdence, and\nhave secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your\nﬁgures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the ﬁrst, I would\nbe completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much\nbetter as I sit by the ﬁre.”\n“Oh!",
    "shocking!” cried Miss Bingley.",
    "“I never heard anything so\nabominable.",
    "How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\n“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth.",
    "“We can all plague and punish one another.",
    "Tease him—laugh at him.",
    "Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\n“But upon my honour, I do not.",
    "I do assure you that my intimacy\nhas not yet taught me that.",
    "Tease calmness of manner and presence of\nmind!",
    "No, no—feel he may defy us there.",
    "And as to laughter, we will\nnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a\nsubject.",
    "Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”\n“Mr.",
    "Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth.",
    "“That is an\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it\nwould be a great loss to meto have many such acquaintances.",
    "I dearly\n39\nlove a laugh.”\n“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.",
    "The\nwisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—\nmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose ﬁrst object in life is a\njoke.”\n“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people, but I hope\nI am not one of them.",
    "I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.",
    "Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, dodivert me, I own,\nand I laugh at them whenever I can.",
    "But these, I suppose, are precisely\nwhat you are without.”\n“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.",
    "But it has been the study\nof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong un-\nderstanding to ridicule.”\n“Such as vanity and pride.”\n“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.",
    "But pride—where there is a real\nsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.",
    "“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bin-\ngley; “and pray what is the result?”\n“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.",
    "He\nowns it himself without disguise.”\n“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension.",
    "I have faults\nenough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.",
    "My temper I dare\nnot vouch for.",
    "It is, I believe, too little yielding—certainly too little for\nthe convenience of the world.",
    "I cannot forget the follies and vices of\nother so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself.",
    "My feelings\nare not puffed about with every attempt to move them.",
    "My temper\nwould perhaps be called resentful.",
    "My good opinion once lost, is lost\nforever.”\n“That is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth.",
    "“Implacable resentment\nisa shade in a character.",
    "But you have chosen your fault well.",
    "I really\ncannot laugh at it.",
    "You are safe from me.”\n“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some par-\nticular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best education can\novercome.”\n“And your defect is to hate everybody.”\n“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunder-\nstand them.”\n“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a con-\nversation in which she had no share.",
    "“Louisa, you will not mind my\nwaking Mr. Hurst?”\n40\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for\nit.",
    "He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.",
    "Chapter 12\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\nwrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might\nbe sent for them in the course of the day.",
    "But Mrs. Bennet, who had\ncalculated on her daughters remaining at Netherﬁeld till the following\nTuesday, which would exactly ﬁnish Jane’s week, could not bring her-\nself to receive them with pleasure before.",
    "Her answer, therefore, was\nnot propitious, at least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient\nto get home.",
    "Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly\nhave the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added,\nthat if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could\nspare them very well.",
    "Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was\npositively resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and\nfearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves\nneedlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage imme-\ndiately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving\nNetherﬁeld that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.",
    "The communication excited many professions of concern; and\nenough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following\nday to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.",
    "Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her\njealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the\nother.",
    "The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to\ngo so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would\nnot be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was\nﬁrm where she felt herself to be right.",
    "To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at\nNetherﬁeld long enough.",
    "She attracted him more than he liked—and\nMiss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself.",
    "He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\nshould now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope\nof inﬂuencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been sug-\ngested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in\nconﬁrming or crushing it.",
    "Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten\n41\nwords to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at\none time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most consci-\nentiously to his book, and would not even look at her.",
    "On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to\nalmost all, took place.",
    "Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased\nat last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they\nparted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give\nher to see her either at Longbourn or Netherﬁeld, and embracing her\nmost tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.",
    "Elizabeth took\nleave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.",
    "They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.",
    "Mrs.\nBennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to\ngive so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.",
    "But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was\nreally glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family cir-\ncle.",
    "The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost\nmuch of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane\nand Elizabeth.",
    "They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and\nhuman nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new obser-\nvations of threadbare morality to listen to.",
    "Catherine and Lydia had in-\nformation for them of a different sort.",
    "Much had been done and much\nhad been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; sev-\neral of the ofﬁcers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been\nﬂogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going\nto be married.",
    "Chapter 13\n“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\nbreakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-\nday, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”\n“Who do you mean, my dear?",
    "I know of nobody that is coming, I\nam sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope\nmydinners are good enough for her.",
    "I do not believe she often sees\nsuch at home.”\n“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”\nMrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled.",
    "“A gentleman and a stranger!",
    "It is Mr.\nBingley, I am sure!",
    "Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.\nBingley.",
    "But—good Lord!",
    "how unlucky!",
    "There is not a bit of ﬁsh to\n42\nbe got to-day.",
    "Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I must speak to Hill this\nmoment.”\n“It is notMr.",
    "Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I\nnever saw in the whole course of my life.”\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of be-\ning eagerly questioned by his wife and his ﬁve daughters at once.",
    "After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus ex-\nplained:\n“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago\nI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring\nearly attention.",
    "It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am\ndead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”\n“Oh!",
    "my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that men-\ntioned.",
    "Pray do not talk of that odious man.",
    "I do think it is the hardest\nthing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your\nown children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long\nago to do something or other about it.”\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.",
    "They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which\nMrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family\nof ﬁve daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything\nabout.",
    "“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and noth-\ning can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.",
    "But if\nyou will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his\nmanner of expressing himself.”\n“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent\nof him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.",
    "I hate such false\nfriends.",
    "Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father\ndid before him?”\n“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some ﬁlial scruples on that\nhead, as you will hear.”\n“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\n15th October.",
    "“Dear Sir,—\n“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late hon-\noured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had\nthe misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach;\nbut for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it\n43\nmight seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms\nwith anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—\n’There, Mrs. Bennet.’—My mind, however, is now made up on the sub-\nject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate\nas to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty\nand beneﬁcence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish,\nwhere it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grate-\nful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those\nrites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.",
    "As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish\nthe blessing of peace in all families within in the reach of my inﬂu-\nence; and on these grounds I ﬂatter myself that my present overtures\nare highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next\nin the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\nside, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.",
    "I cannot be\notherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable\ndaughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of\nmy readiness to make them every possible amends—but of this here-\nafter.",
    "If you should have no objection to receive me into your house,\nI propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family,\nMonday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass\non your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight following, which I can\ndo without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting\nto my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other cler-\ngyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear sir, with\nrespectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher\nand friend,\n“William Collins ”\n“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gen-\ntleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.",
    "“He seems to be a\nmost conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt\nnot will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine\nshould be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.”\n“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and\nif he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\ndiscourage him.”\n“Though it is difﬁcult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can\nmean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly\nto his credit.”\n44\nElizabeth was chieﬂy struck by his extraordinary deference for\nLady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and\nburying his parishioners whenever it were required.",
    "“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she.",
    "“I cannot make him\nout.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can\nhe mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot sup-\npose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man, sir?”\n“No, my dear, I think not.",
    "I have great hopes of ﬁnding him quite\nthe reverse.",
    "There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\nletter, which promises well.",
    "I am impatient to see him.”\n“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem de-\nfective.",
    "The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\nthink it is well expressed.”\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any\ndegree interesting.",
    "It was next to impossible that their cousin should\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had re-\nceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.",
    "As for\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\nastonished her husband and daughters.",
    "Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\npoliteness by the whole family.",
    "Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in\nneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.",
    "He was a\ntall, heavy-looking young man of ﬁve-and-twenty.",
    "His air was grave\nand stately, and his manners were very formal.",
    "He had not been long\nseated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so ﬁne a family\nof daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this\ninstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\ndoubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.",
    "This\ngallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\nBennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.",
    "“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\nprove so, for else they will be destitute enough.",
    "Things are settled so\noddly.”\n“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”\n“Ah!",
    "sir, I do indeed.",
    "It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\nmust confess.",
    "Not that I mean to ﬁnd fault with you, for such things\nI know are all chance in this world.",
    "There is no knowing how estates\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.”\n“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\n45\nand could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\nforward and precipitate.",
    "But I can assure the young ladies that I come\nprepared to admire them.",
    "At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,\nwhen we are better acquainted—”\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\non each other.",
    "They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admi-\nration.",
    "The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined\nand praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched\nMrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing\nit all as his own future property.",
    "The dinner too in its turn was highly\nadmired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the ex-\ncellency of its cooking was owing.",
    "But he was set right there by Mrs.\nBennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well\nable to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in\nthe kitchen.",
    "He begged pardon for having displeased her.",
    "In a soft-\nened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to\napologise for about a quarter of an hour.",
    "Chapter 14\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the ser-\nvants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation\nwith his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him\nto shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.",
    "Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration\nfor his comfort, appeared very remarkable.",
    "Mr. Bennet could not have\nchosen better.",
    "Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.",
    "The subject el-\nevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most\nimportant aspect he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed\nsuch behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension,\nas he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.",
    "She had been\ngraciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had\nalready had the honour of preaching before her.",
    "She had also asked\nhim twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday\nbefore, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.",
    "Lady Cather-\nine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but hehad never\nseen anything but affability in her.",
    "She had always spoken to him as\nshe would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection\nto his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving\nthe parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.",
    "She\n46\nhad even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could,\nprovided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in\nhis humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alter-\nations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\nherself—some shelves in the closet upstairs.”\n“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and\nI dare say she is a very agreeable woman.",
    "It is a pity that great ladies\nin general are not more like her.",
    "Does she live near you, sir?”\n“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only\nby a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.”\n“I think you said she was a widow, sir?",
    "Has she any family?”\n“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\nextensive property.”\n“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off\nthan many girls.",
    "And what sort of young lady is she?",
    "Is she hand-\nsome?”\n“She is a most charming young lady indeed.",
    "Lady Catherine her-\nself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior\nto the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features\nwhich marks the young lady of distinguished birth.",
    "She is unfortu-\nnately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making\nthat progress in many accomplishments which she could not have oth-\nerwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her\neducation, and who still resides with them.",
    "But she is perfectly ami-\nable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little\nphaeton and ponies.”\n“Has she been presented?",
    "I do not remember her name among the\nladies at court.”\n“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\ntown; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has de-\nprived the British court of its brightest ornaments.",
    "Her ladyship\nseemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy\non every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are\nalways acceptable to ladies.",
    "I have more than once observed to Lady\nCatherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess,\nand that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence,\nwould be adorned by her.",
    "These are the kind of little things which\nplease her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive my-\nself peculiarly bound to pay.”\n“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for\nyou that you possess the talent of ﬂattering with delicacy.",
    "May I ask\n47\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the mo-\nment, or are the result of previous study?”\n“They arise chieﬂy from what is passing at the time, and though I\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little el-\negant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always\nwish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.”\nMr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered.",
    "His cousin was as\nabsurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest en-\njoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of\ncountenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requir-\ning no partner in his pleasure.",
    "By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet\nwas glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea\nwas over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.",
    "Mr. Collins\nreadily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for\neverything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started\nback, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.",
    "Kitty\nstared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.",
    "Other books were produced, and\nafter some deliberation he chose Fordyce’s Sermons.",
    "Lydia gaped as he\nopened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solem-\nnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:\n“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning\naway Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.",
    "My aunt\ntold me so herself on Saturday.",
    "I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow\nto hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from\ntown.”\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\n“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\nbooks of a serious stamp, though written solely for their beneﬁt.",
    "It\namazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advanta-\ngeous to them as instruction.",
    "But I will no longer importune my young\ncousin.”\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\nbackgammon.",
    "Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he\nacted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own triﬂing amusements.",
    "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia’s in-\nterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\n48\nfor backgammon.",
    "Chapter 15\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deﬁciency of nature\nhad been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part\nof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\nhad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\nacquaintance.",
    "The subjection in which his father had brought him up\nhad given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\ngood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in re-\ntirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected pros-\nperity.",
    "A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine\nde Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect\nwhich he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his pa-\ntroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority\nas a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture\nof pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.",
    "Having now a good house and a very sufﬁcient income, he in-\ntended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn\nfamily he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the\ndaughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were\nrepresented by common report.",
    "This was his plan of amends—of\natonement—for inheriting their father’s estate; and he thought it an\nexcellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively gen-\nerous and disinterested on his own part.",
    "His plan did not vary on seeing them.",
    "Miss Bennet’s lovely face\nconﬁrmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\nwas due to seniority; and for the ﬁrst evening shewas his settled choice.",
    "The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an\nhour’s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation be-\nginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal\nof his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, pro-\nduced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encour-\nagement, a caution against the very Jane he had ﬁxed on.",
    "“As to her\nyounger daughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could not\npositively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession; her el-\ndestdaughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to\nhint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”\n49\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was\nsoon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the ﬁre.",
    "Elizabeth,\nequally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.",
    "Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon\nhave two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to\nspeak of the day before was now high in her good graces.",
    "Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every\nsister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to at-\ntend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to\nget rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins\nhad followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nomi-\nnally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really\ntalking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at\nHunsford.",
    "Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.",
    "In his\nlibrary he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though\nprepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every\nother room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\ncivility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his\ndaughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better ﬁt-\nted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large\nbook, and go.",
    "In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.",
    "The attention\nof the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.",
    "Their\neyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the ofﬁ-\ncers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new\nmuslin in a shop window, could recall them.",
    "But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\nwhom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance,\nwalking with another ofﬁcer on the other side of the way.",
    "The ofﬁcer\nwas the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia\ncame to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.",
    "All were struck with\nthe stranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Ly-\ndia, determined if possible to ﬁnd out, led the way across the street,\nunder pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortu-\nnately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning\nback, had reached the same spot.",
    "Mr. Denny addressed them directly,\nand entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who\nhad returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy\nto say had accepted a commission in their corps.",
    "This was exactly as\nit should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him\n50\ncompletely charming.",
    "His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had\nall the best part of beauty, a ﬁne countenance, a good ﬁgure, and very\npleasing address.",
    "The introduction was followed up on his side by\na happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time per-\nfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing\nand talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew\ntheir notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.",
    "On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came di-\nrectly towards them, and began the usual civilities.",
    "Bingley was the\nprincipal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.",
    "He was\nthen, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.",
    "Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine\nnot to ﬁx his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by\nthe sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the counte-\nnance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the\neffect of the meeting.",
    "Both changed colour, one looked white, the other\nred.",
    "Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation\nwhich Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.",
    "What could be the meaning of\nit?",
    "It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.",
    "In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have no-\nticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.",
    "Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the\ndoor of Mr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss\nLydia’s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite\nof Mrs. Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window and loudly second-\ning the invitation.",
    "Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,\nfrom their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was ea-\ngerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as\ntheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known noth-\ning about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the\nstreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts\nto Netherﬁeld because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her\ncivility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him.",
    "She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with\nas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous ac-\nquaintance with her, which he could not help ﬂattering himself, how-\never, might be justiﬁed by his relationship to the young ladies who\nintroduced him to her notice.",
    "Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such\nan excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was\nsoon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of\n51\nwhom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew,\nthat Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have\na lieutenant’s commission in the ——shire.",
    "She had been watching him\nthe last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had\nMr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have contin-\nued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except\na few of the ofﬁcers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were be-\ncome “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with\nthe Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her hus-\nband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the fam-\nily from Longbourn would come in the evening.",
    "This was agreed to,\nand Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable\nnoisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.",
    "The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in\nmutual good spirits.",
    "Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the\nroom, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were per-\nfectly needless.",
    "As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen\npass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have de-\nfended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could\nno more explain such behaviour than her sister.",
    "Mr. Collins on his return highly gratiﬁed Mrs. Bennet by admiring\nMrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness.",
    "He protested that, except Lady\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;\nfor she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\nutterly unknown to her before.",
    "Something, he supposed, might be at-\ntributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.",
    "Chapter 16\nAs no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with\ntheir aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet\nfor a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the\ncoach conveyed him and his ﬁve cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton;\nand the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-\nroom, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was\nthen in the house.",
    "When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats,\n52\nMr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was\nso much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he\ndeclared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer\nbreakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at ﬁrst convey\nmuch gratiﬁcation; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what\nRosings was, and who was its proprietor—when she had listened to\nthe description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and\nfound that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds,\nshe felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have re-\nsented a comparison with the housekeeper’s room.",
    "In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\nmansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\nabode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily em-\nployed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips\na very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased\nwith what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her\nneighbours as soon as she could.",
    "To the girls, who could not listen to\ntheir cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instru-\nment, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.",
    "It was over at\nlast, however.",
    "The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham\nwalked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing\nhim before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of un-\nreasonable admiration.",
    "The ofﬁcers of the ——shire were in general\na very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the\npresent party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person,\ncountenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced,\nstuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the\nroom.",
    "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every fe-\nmale eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom\nhe ﬁnally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he im-\nmediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet\nnight, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic\nmight be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.",
    "With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\nofﬁcers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insigniﬁcance; to the young\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind lis-\ntener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly\nsupplied with coffee and mufﬁn.",
    "When the card-tables were placed, he\nhad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.",
    "53\n“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad\nto improve myself, for in my situation in life—” Mrs. Phillips was very\nglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.",
    "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.",
    "At ﬁrst there\nseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making\nbets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in partic-\nular.",
    "Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham\nwas therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing\nto hear him, though what she chieﬂy wished to hear she could not\nhope to be told—the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.",
    "She\ndared not even mention that gentleman.",
    "Her curiosity, however, was\nunexpectedly relieved.",
    "Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.",
    "He\ninquired how far Netherﬁeld was from Meryton; and, after receiving\nher answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been\nstaying there.",
    "“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the sub-\nject drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\nunderstand.”\n“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one.",
    "A clear\nten thousand per annum.",
    "You could not have met with a person more\ncapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\nI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my\ninfancy.”\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.",
    "“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\nyesterday.",
    "Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\n“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly.",
    "“I\nhave spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\ndisagreeable.”\n“I have no right to give myopinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise.",
    "I am not qualiﬁed to form one.",
    "I have known\nhim too long and too well to be a fair judge.",
    "It is impossible for me\nto be impartial.",
    "But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly any-\nwhere else.",
    "Here you are in your own family.”\n“Upon my word, I say no more herethan I might say in any house\nin the neighbourhood, except Netherﬁeld.",
    "He is not at all liked in Hert-\n54\nfordshire.",
    "Everybody is disgusted with his pride.",
    "You will not ﬁnd him\nmore favourably spoken of by anyone.”\n“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short inter-\nruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their\ndeserts; but with himI believe it does not often happen.",
    "The world is\nblinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and\nimposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\n“I should take him, even on myslight acquaintance, to be an ill-\ntempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.",
    "“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether\nhe is likely to be in this country much longer.”\n“I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when\nI was at Netherﬁeld.",
    "I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\n“Oh!",
    "no—it is not for meto be driven away by Mr. Darcy.",
    "If he\nwishes to avoid seeing me, he must go.",
    "We are not on friendly terms,\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding himbut what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\nof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\nis.",
    "His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best\nmen that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can\nnever be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the\nsoul by a thousand tender recollections.",
    "His behaviour to myself has\nbeen scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\nmemory of his father.”\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened\nwith all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.",
    "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible\ngallantry.",
    "“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he\nadded, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire.",
    "I\nknew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny\ntempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the\nvery great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had pro-\ncured them.",
    "Society, I own, is necessary to me.",
    "I have been a disap-\npointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.",
    "I must have em-\nployment and society.",
    "A military life is not what I was intended for,\nbut circumstances have now made it eligible.",
    "The church ought to have\n55\nbeen my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should\nat this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\npleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”\n“Indeed!”\n“Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of\nthe best living in his gift.",
    "He was my godfather, and excessively at-\ntached to me.",
    "I cannot do justice to his kindness.",
    "He meant to provide\nfor me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it\nwas given elsewhere.”\n“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could thatbe?",
    "How\ncould his will be disregarded?",
    "Why did you not seek legal redress?”\n“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\ngive me no hope from law.",
    "A man of honour could not have doubted\nthe intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence—in short anything or nothing.",
    "Cer-\ntain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\nof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less\ncertain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything\nto deserve to lose it.",
    "I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have\nspoken my opinion ofhim, and tohim, too freely.",
    "I can recall nothing\nworse.",
    "But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that\nhe hates me.”\n“This is quite shocking!",
    "He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\n“Some time or other he willbe—but it shall not be by me.",
    "Till I can\nforget his father, I can never defy or expose him.”\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him hand-\nsomer than ever as he expressed them.",
    "“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?",
    "What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”\n“A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot\nbut attribute in some measure to jealousy.",
    "Had the late Mr. Darcy liked\nme less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s un-\ncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.",
    "He\nhad not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—\nthe sort of preference which was often given me.”\n“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never\nliked him.",
    "I had not thought so very ill of him.",
    "I had supposed him to\nbe despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity\nas this.”\n56\nAfter a few minutes’ reﬂection, however, she continued, “I dore-\nmember his boasting one day, at Netherﬁeld, of the implacability of\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.",
    "His disposition\nmust be dreadful.”\n“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can\nhardly be just to him.”\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\n“To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\nfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like you, whose\nvery countenance may vouch for your being amiable”—but she con-\ntented herself with, “and one, too, who had probably been his com-\npanion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the\nclosest manner!”\n“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the great-\nest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.",
    "My\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, ap-\npears to do so much credit to—but he gave up everything to be of use\nto the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pember-\nley property.",
    "He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most inti-\nmate, conﬁdential friend.",
    "Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be\nunder the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence,\nand when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him\na voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\nto be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.”\n“How strange!” cried Elizabeth.",
    "“How abominable!",
    "I wonder that\nthe very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!",
    "If\nfrom no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be\ndishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.”\n“Itiswonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may\nbe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.",
    "It has con-\nnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling.",
    "But we are\nnone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.”\n“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\n“Yes.",
    "It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve\nthe poor.",
    "Family pride, and ﬁlial pride—for he is very proud of what\nhis father was—have done this.",
    "Not to appear to disgrace his family,\nto degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the inﬂuence of the\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive.",
    "He has also brotherly pride,\n57\nwhich, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and care-\nful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as\nthe most attentive and best of brothers.”\n“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”\nHe shook his head.",
    "“I wish I could call her amiable.",
    "It gives me pain\nto speak ill of a Darcy.",
    "But she is too much like her brother—very, very\nproud.",
    "As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely\nfond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.",
    "But she is nothing to me now.",
    "She is a handsome girl, about ﬁfteen\nor sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished.",
    "Since her father’s\ndeath, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\nsuperintends her education.”\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\ncould not help reverting once more to the ﬁrst, and saying:\n“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!",
    "How can Mr.\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly\namiable, be in friendship with such a man?",
    "How can they suit each\nother?",
    "Do you know Mr. Bingley?”\n“Not at all.”\n“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.",
    "He cannot know\nwhat Mr. Darcy is.”\n“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.",
    "He does\nnot want abilities.",
    "He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it\nworth his while.",
    "Among those who are at all his equals in consequence,\nhe is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.",
    "His\npride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\nsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable—allowing some-\nthing for fortune and ﬁgure.”\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gath-\nered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between\nhis cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.",
    "The usual inquiries as to his\nsuccess was made by the latter.",
    "It had not been very great; he had\nlost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern\nthereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not\nof the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere triﬂe,\nand begged that she would not make herself uneasy.",
    "“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down\nto a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and hap-\npily I am not in such circumstances as to make ﬁve shillings any object.",
    "There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks\nto Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity\n58\nof regarding little matters.”\nMr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr.\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\nwhether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family\nof de Bourgh.",
    "“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given\nhim a living.",
    "I hardly know how Mr. Collins was ﬁrst introduced to\nher notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\n“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady\nAnne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present\nMr. Darcy.”\n“No, indeed, I did not.",
    "I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\nconnections.",
    "I never heard of her existence till the day before yester-\nday.”\n“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and\nit is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\nBingley.",
    "Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-\ndestined for another.",
    "“Mr.",
    "Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and\nher daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her la-\ndyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her\nbeing his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”\n“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I\nhave not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I\nnever liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.",
    "She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I\nrather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and for-\ntune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride\nfor her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should\nhave an understanding of the ﬁrst class.”\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,\nand they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till sup-\nper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of\nMr. Wickham’s attentions.",
    "There could be no conversation in the noise\nof Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\neverybody.",
    "Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did,\ndone gracefully.",
    "Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.",
    "She\ncould think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told\nher, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention\n59\nhis name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once\nsilent.",
    "Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the ﬁsh she had\nlost and the ﬁsh she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the ci-\nvility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least\nregard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and re-\npeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he\ncould well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.",
    "Chapter 17\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.\nWickham and herself.",
    "Jane listened with astonishment and concern;\nshe knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy\nof Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question\nthe veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.",
    "The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,\nand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not\nbe otherwise explained.",
    "“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some\nway or other, of which we can form no idea.",
    "Interested people have\nperhaps misrepresented each to the other.",
    "It is, in short, impossible for\nus to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated\nthem, without actual blame on either side.”\n“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to\nsay on behalf of the interested people who have probably been con-\ncerned in the business?",
    "Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to\nthink ill of somebody.”\n“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of\nmy opinion.",
    "My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful\nlight it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a\nmanner, one whom his father had promised to provide for.",
    "It is impos-\nsible.",
    "No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for\nhis character, could be capable of it.",
    "Can his most intimate friends be\nso excessively deceived in him?",
    "Oh!",
    "no.”\n“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on,\nthan that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he\ngave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without cere-\nmony.",
    "If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.",
    "Besides, there was\n60\ntruth in his looks.”\n“It is difﬁcult indeed—it is distressing.",
    "One does not know what to\nthink.”\n“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr.\nBingley, if he hadbeen imposed on, would have much to suffer when\nthe affair became public.",
    "The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where\nthis conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\npersonal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherﬁeld, which\nwas ﬁxed for the following Tuesday.",
    "The two ladies were delighted\nto see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their sep-\naration.",
    "To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding\nMrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and\nnothing at all to the others.",
    "They were soon gone again, rising from\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.",
    "The prospect of the Netherﬁeld ball was extremely agreeable to\nevery female of the family.",
    "Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given\nin compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly ﬂattered\nby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a cere-\nmonious card.",
    "Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society\nof her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth\nthought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and\nof seeing a conﬁrmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behav-\nior.",
    "The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less\non any single event, or any particular person, for though they each,\nlike Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he\nwas by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\nwas, at any rate, a ball.",
    "And even Mary could assure her family that\nshe had no disinclination for it.",
    "“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough—\nI think it is no sacriﬁce to join occasionally in evening engagements.",
    "Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every-\nbody.”\nElizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she\ndid not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help\nasking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and\n61\nif he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\namusement; and she was rather surprised to ﬁnd that he entertained\nno scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a\nrebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by\nventuring to dance.",
    "“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a\nball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable\npeople, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to\ndancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all\nmy fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity\nof soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two ﬁrst dances especially, a\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,\nand not to any disrespect for her.”\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in.",
    "She had fully proposed\nbeing engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr.\nCollins instead!",
    "her liveliness had never been worse timed.",
    "There was\nno help for it, however.",
    "Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own were\nperforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted\nwith as good a grace as she could.",
    "She was not the better pleased with\nhis gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more.",
    "It now\nﬁrst struck her, that shewas selected from among her sisters as worthy\nof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.",
    "The\nidea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civili-\nties toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on\nher wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratiﬁed her-\nself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave\nher to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely\nagreeable to her.",
    "Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint,\nbeing well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of\nany reply.",
    "Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it\nwas useless to quarrel about him.",
    "If there had not been a Netherﬁeld ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this\ntime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.",
    "No aunt, no ofﬁcers, no news could be sought after—the very shoe-\nroses for Netherﬁeld were got by proxy.",
    "Even Elizabeth might have\nfound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended\nthe improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing\nless than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday,\n62\nSunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.",
    "Chapter 18\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherﬁeld, and looked\nin vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assem-\nbled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.",
    "The cer-\ntainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollec-\ntions that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.",
    "She had dressed\nwith more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the\nconquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it\nwas not more than might be won in the course of the evening.",
    "But in\nan instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted\nfor Mr. Darcy’s pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the ofﬁcers; and\nthough this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence\nwas pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied,\nand who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on\nbusiness the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a sig-\nniﬁcant smile, “I do not imagine his business would have called him\naway just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught\nby Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable\nfor Wickham’s absence than if her ﬁrst surmise had been just, every\nfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by imme-\ndiate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable ci-\nvility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached\nto make.",
    "Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury\nto Wickham.",
    "She was resolved against any sort of conversation with\nhim, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could\nnot wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind\npartiality provoked her.",
    "But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\nprospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell\nlong on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas,\nwhom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a vol-\nuntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to\nher particular notice.",
    "The ﬁrst two dances, however, brought a return\nof distress; they were dances of mortiﬁcation.",
    "Mr. Collins, awkward\nand solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\n63\ndisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.",
    "The moment of\nher release from him was ecstasy.",
    "She danced next with an ofﬁcer, and had the refreshment of talk-\ning of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.",
    "When\nthose dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in\nconversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed\nby Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for\nher hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.",
    "He\nwalked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own\nwant of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:\n“I dare say you will ﬁnd him very agreeable.”\n“Heaven forbid!",
    "That would be the greatest misfortune of all!",
    "To\nﬁnd a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!",
    "Do not wish\nme such an evil.”\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached\nto claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper,\nnot to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her\nappear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence.",
    "Eliz-\nabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dig-\nnity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.\nDarcy, and reading in her neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in\nbeholding it.",
    "They stood for some time without speaking a word; and\nshe began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two\ndances, and at ﬁrst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying\nthat it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to\ntalk, she made some slight observation on the dance.",
    "He replied, and\nwas again silent.",
    "After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a\nsecond time with:—“It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.",
    "I\ntalked about the dance, and youought to make some sort of remark on\nthe size of the room, or the number of couples.”\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\nshould be said.",
    "“Very well.",
    "That reply will do for the present.",
    "Perhaps by and by\nI may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.",
    "Butnowwe may be silent.”\n“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\n“Sometimes.",
    "One must speak a little, you know.",
    "It would look odd\nto be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage\nofsome, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have\nthe trouble of saying as little as possible.”\n“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\n64\nyou imagine that you are gratifying mine?”\n“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.",
    "We are each of an unsocial, taciturn\ndisposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that\nwill amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all\nthe eclat of a proverb.”\n“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am\nsure,” said he.",
    "“How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say.",
    "Youthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”\n“I must not decide on my own performance.”\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\ndown the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very\noften walk to Meryton.",
    "She answered in the afﬁrmative, and, unable\nto resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day,\nwe had just been forming a new acquaintance.”\nThe effect was immediate.",
    "A deeper shade of hauteur overspread\nhis features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming\nherself for her own weakness, could not go on.",
    "At length Darcy spoke,\nand in a constrained manner said, “Mr.",
    "Wickham is blessed with such\nhappy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be\nequally capable of retaining them, is less certain.”\n“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Eliza-\nbeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from\nall his life.”\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the sub-\nject.",
    "At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, mean-\ning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on per-\nceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to com-\npliment him on his dancing and his partner.",
    "“I have been most highly gratiﬁed indeed, my dear sir.",
    "Such very\nsuperior dancing is not often seen.",
    "It is evident that you belong to the\nﬁrst circles.",
    "Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\nher sister and Bingley) shall take place.",
    "What congratulations will then\nﬂow in!",
    "I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir.",
    "You\nwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\nSir William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and\nhis eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley\n65\nand Jane, who were dancing together.",
    "Recovering himself, however,\nshortly, he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William’s interruption\nhas made me forget what we were talking of.”\n“I do not think we were speaking at all.",
    "Sir William could not have\ninterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.",
    "We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what\nwe are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\n“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.",
    "“Books—oh!",
    "no.",
    "I am sure we never read the same, or not with the\nsame feelings.”\n“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject.",
    "We may compare our different opinions.”\n“No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full\nof something else.”\n“The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?” said he,\nwith a look of doubt.",
    "“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards ap-\npeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say,\nMr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once cre-\nated was unappeasable.",
    "You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being\ncreated .”\n“I am,” said he, with a ﬁrm voice.",
    "“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\n“I hope not.”\n“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opin-\nion, to be secure of judging properly at ﬁrst.”\n“May I ask to what these questions tend?”\n“Merely to the illustration of your character,” said she, endeavour-\ning to shake off her gravity.",
    "“I am trying to make it out.”\n“And what is your success?”\nShe shook her head.",
    "“I do not get on at all.",
    "I hear such different\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”\n“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you\nwere not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is rea-\nson to fear that the performance would reﬂect no credit on either.”\n“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.”\n“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly\nreplied.",
    "She said no more, and they went down the other dance and\n66\nparted in silence; and on each side dissatisﬁed, though not to an equal\ndegree, for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling to-\nwards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger\nagainst another.",
    "They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her,\nand with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\n“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wick-\nham!",
    "Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a\nthousand questions; and I ﬁnd that the young man quite forgot to tell\nyou, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wick-\nham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward.",
    "Let me recommend you, however,\nas a friend, not to give implicit conﬁdence to all his assertions; for as\nto Mr. Darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary,\nhe has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham\nhas treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.",
    "I do not know the\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to\nblame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and\nthat though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including\nhim in his invitation to the ofﬁcers, he was excessively glad to ﬁnd that\nhe had taken himself out of the way.",
    "His coming into the country at all\nis a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume\nto do it.",
    "I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s\nguilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much\nbetter.”\n“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,”\nsaid Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\nworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of that, I can\nassure you, he informed me himself.”\n“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\nsneer.",
    "“Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.”\n“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself.",
    "“You are much mistaken if\nyou expect to inﬂuence me by such a paltry attack as this.",
    "I see nothing\nin it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.” She\nthen sought her eldest sister, who has undertaken to make inquiries on\nthe same subject of Bingley.",
    "Jane met her with a smile of such sweet\ncomplacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufﬁciently marked\nhow well she was satisﬁed with the occurrences of the evening.",
    "Eliz-\nabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\nWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\nway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.",
    "“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than\n67\nher sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.",
    "But perhaps\nyou have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in\nwhich case you may be sure of my pardon.”\n“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\nsatisfactory to tell you.",
    "Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have princi-\npally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the\nprobity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr.\nWickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\nreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister’s, Mr.\nWickham is by no means a respectable young man.",
    "I am afraid he has\nbeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”\n“Mr.",
    "Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”\n“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\n“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.",
    "I am\nsatisﬁed.",
    "But what does he say of the living?”\n“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\nheard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was\nleft to him conditionally only.”\n“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth\nwarmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances\nonly.",
    "Mr. Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare\nsay; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and\nhas learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think\nof both gentlemen as I did before.”\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and\non which there could be no difference of sentiment.",
    "Elizabeth listened\nwith delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane enter-\ntained of Mr. Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten\nher conﬁdence in it.",
    "On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Eliz-\nabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness\nof her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came\nup to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so\nfortunate as to make a most important discovery.",
    "“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is\nnow in the room a near relation of my patroness.",
    "I happened to over-\nhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the\nhonours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of\nher mother Lady Catherine.",
    "How wonderfully these sort of things oc-\ncur!",
    "Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew\nof Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!",
    "I am most thankful that\n68\nthe discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which\nI am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it\nbefore.",
    "My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\n“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”\n“Indeed I am.",
    "I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it ear-\nlier.",
    "I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s nephew .",
    "It will be in my power\nto assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring\nhim that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without intro-\nduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his\naunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice\non either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the su-\nperior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.",
    "Mr. Collins listened\nto her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and,\nwhen she ceased speaking, replied thus:\n“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\nyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your under-\nstanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference be-\ntween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\nthe clerical ofﬁce as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in\nthe kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\nsame time maintained.",
    "You must therefore allow me to follow the dic-\ntates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform\nwhat I look on as a point of duty.",
    "Pardon me for neglecting to proﬁt by\nyour advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\nthough in the case before us I consider myself more ﬁtted by education\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\nyourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonish-\nment at being so addressed was very evident.",
    "Her cousin prefaced his\nspeech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it,\nshe felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words\n“apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed\nher to see him expose himself to such a man.",
    "Mr. Darcy was eyeing\nhim with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed\nhim time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.",
    "Mr. Collins,\nhowever, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s\ncontempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second\nspeech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved\nanother way.",
    "Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.",
    "69\n“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisﬁed with\nmy reception.",
    "Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.",
    "He\nanswered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compli-\nment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s dis-\ncernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.",
    "It was really a very handsome thought.",
    "Upon the whole, I am much\npleased with him.”\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she\nturned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and\nthe train of agreeable reﬂections which her observations gave birth to,\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.",
    "She saw her in idea settled\nin that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\ncould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of en-\ndeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters.",
    "Her mother’s thoughts\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much.",
    "When they sat down to\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to\nﬁnd that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\nopenly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be\nmarried to Mr. Bingley.",
    "It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\nseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\nmatch.",
    "His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living\nbut three miles from them, were the ﬁrst points of self-gratulation; and\nthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\nshe could do.",
    "It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\ndaughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way\nof other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to\nbe able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.",
    "It\nwas necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because\non such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than\nMrs. Bennet to ﬁnd comfort in staying home at any period of her life.",
    "She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be\nequally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there\nwas no chance of it.",
    "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\nmother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less au-\ndible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive\nthat the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to\n70\nthem.",
    "Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.",
    "“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?",
    "I\nam sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\nnothing hemay not like to hear.”\n“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower.",
    "What advantage can it\nbe for you to offend Mr. Darcy?",
    "You will never recommend yourself to\nhis friend by so doing!”\nNothing that she could say, however, had any inﬂuence.",
    "Her\nmother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.",
    "Eliza-\nbeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.",
    "She could\nnot help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance\nconvinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always look-\ning at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably\nﬁxed by her.",
    "The expression of his face changed gradually from indig-\nnant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.",
    "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lu-\ncas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she\nsaw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\nchicken.",
    "Elizabeth now began to revive.",
    "But not long was the inter-\nval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of,\nand she had the mortiﬁcation of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company.",
    "By many signiﬁcant looks and silent\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\nbut in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.",
    "Elizabeth’s\neyes were ﬁxed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched\nher progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which\nwas very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst\nthe thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed\non to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began an-\nother.",
    "Mary’s powers were by no means ﬁtted for such a display; her\nvoice was weak, and her manner affected.",
    "Elizabeth was in agonies.",
    "She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very compos-\nedly talking to Bingley.",
    "She looked at his two sisters, and saw them\nmaking signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued,\nhowever, imperturbably grave.",
    "She looked at her father to entreat his\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night.",
    "He took the hint,\nand when Mary had ﬁnished her second song, said aloud, “That will\ndo extremely well, child.",
    "You have delighted us long enough.",
    "Let the\nother young ladies have time to exhibit.”\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;\n71\nand Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was\nafraid her anxiety had done no good.",
    "Others of the party were now\napplied to.",
    "“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with\nan air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman.",
    "I do not mean, how-\never, to assert that we can be justiﬁed in devoting too much of our time\nto music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.",
    "The rec-\ntor of a parish has much to do.",
    "In the ﬁrst place, he must make such\nan agreement for tithes as may be beneﬁcial to himself and not offen-\nsive to his patron.",
    "He must write his own sermons; and the time that\nremains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and\nimprovement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from mak-\ning as comfortable as possible.",
    "And I do not think it of light impor-\ntance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards\neverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.",
    "I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\nshould omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody con-\nnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his\nspeech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.",
    "Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\nBennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\nhaving spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lu-\ncas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.",
    "To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\nto expose themselves as much as a they could during the evening, it\nwould have been impossible for them to play their parts with more\nspirit or ﬁner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her\nsister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which\nhe must have witnessed.",
    "That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however,\nshould have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad\nenough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of\nthe gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolera-\nble.",
    "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.",
    "She was\nteased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side,\nand though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it\nout of her power to dance with others.",
    "In vain did she entreat him to\nstand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young\n72\nlady in the room.",
    "He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly\nindifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to rec-\nommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of\nremaining close to her the whole evening.",
    "There was no arguing upon\nsuch a project.",
    "She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas,\nwho often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s con-\nversation to herself.",
    "She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further notice;\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite dis-\nengaged, he never came near enough to speak.",
    "She felt it to be the\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\nit.",
    "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\nand, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a\nquarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them\ntime to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the fam-\nily.",
    "Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to\ncomplain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house\nto themselves.",
    "They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conver-\nsation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which\nwas very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was\ncomplimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their\nentertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked\ntheir behaviour to their guests.",
    "Darcy said nothing at all.",
    "Mr. Bennet,\nin equal silence, was enjoying the scene.",
    "Mr. Bingley and Jane were\nstanding together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to\neach other.",
    "Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst\nor Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more\nthan the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompa-\nnied by a violent yawn.",
    "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\npressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Long-\nbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him\nhow happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them\nat any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.",
    "Bingley was\nall grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest op-\nportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he\nwas obliged to go the next day for a short time.",
    "Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisﬁed, and quitted the house under\nthe delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations\nof settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should un-\n73\ndoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherﬁeld in the course of three\nor four months.",
    "Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins,\nshe thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not\nequal, pleasure.",
    "Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children;\nand though the man and the match were quite good enough for her,\nthe worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherﬁeld.",
    "Chapter 19\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.",
    "Mr. Collins made\nhis declaration in form.",
    "Having resolved to do it without loss of time,\nas his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and\nhaving no feelings of difﬁdence to make it distressing to himself even\nat the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\nobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business.",
    "On\nﬁnding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\nsoon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\n“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Eliz-\nabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in\nthe course of this morning?”\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\nBennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!—yes—certainly.",
    "I am sure Lizzy\nwill be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection.",
    "Come, Kitty,\nI want you upstairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was has-\ntening away, when Elizabeth called out:\n“Dear madam, do not go.",
    "I beg you will not go.",
    "Mr. Collins must\nexcuse me.",
    "He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not\nhear.",
    "I am going away myself.”\n“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.",
    "I desire you to stay where you are.” And\nupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks,\nabout to escape, she added: “Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hear-\ning Mr. Collins.”\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment’s\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried\nto conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided\nbetween distress and diversion.",
    "Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and\nas soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.",
    "“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.",
    "You\n74\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there notbeen this little\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\nmother’s permission for this address.",
    "You can hardly doubt the pur-\nport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.",
    "Al-\nmost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the compan-\nion of my future life.",
    "But before I am run away with by my feelings on\nthis subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons\nfor marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the\ndesign of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run\naway with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she\ncould not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him\nfurther, and he continued:\n“My reasons for marrying are, ﬁrst, that I think it a right thing for\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the exam-\nple of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it\nwill add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps\nI ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of\ncalling patroness.",
    "Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion\n(unasked too!)",
    "on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night\nbefore I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.\nJenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool, that she said, ‘Mr.",
    "Collins, you must marry.",
    "A clergyman like you must marry.",
    "Choose\nproperly, choose a gentlewoman for mysake; and for your own, let her\nbe an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to\nmake a small income go a good way.",
    "This is my advice.",
    "Find such\na woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit\nher.’ Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not\nreckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among\nthe least of the advantages in my power to offer.",
    "You will ﬁnd her\nmanners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity,\nI think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the\nsilence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.",
    "Thus much\nfor my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told\nwhy my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own\nneighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young\nwomen.",
    "But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate af-\nter the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many\nyears longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a\n75\nwife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little\nas possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however,\nas I have already said, may not be for several years.",
    "This has been my\nmotive, my fair cousin, and I ﬂatter myself it will not sink me in your\nesteem.",
    "And now nothing remains but for me but to assure you in the\nmost animated language of the violence of my affection.",
    "To fortune I\nam perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on\nyour father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with;\nand that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be\nyours till after your mother’s decease, is all that you may ever be en-\ntitled to.",
    "On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you\nmay assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my\nlips when we are married.”\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.",
    "“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried.",
    "“You forget that I have made no\nanswer.",
    "Let me do it without further loss of time.",
    "Accept my thanks for\nthe compliment you are paying me.",
    "I am very sensible of the honour\nof your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to\ndecline them.”\n“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\nof the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses\nof the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he ﬁrst applies\nfor their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second,\nor even a third time.",
    "I am therefore by no means discouraged by what\nyou have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\n“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather extra-\nordinary one after my declaration.",
    "I do assure you that I am not one of\nthose young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring\nas to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.",
    "I am perfectly serious in my refusal.",
    "You could not make mehappy,\nand I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could\nmake you so.",
    "Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\nam persuaded she would ﬁnd me in every respect ill qualiﬁed for the\nsituation.”\n“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr.\nCollins very gravely—“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would\nat all disapprove of you.",
    "And you may be certain when I have the hon-\nour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\nmodesty, economy, and other amiable qualiﬁcation.”\n“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.",
    "You must\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of be-\n76\nlieving what I say.",
    "I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refus-\ning your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.",
    "In\nmaking me the offer, you must have satisﬁed the delicacy of your feel-\nings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.",
    "This matter may be\nconsidered, therefore, as ﬁnally settled.” And rising as she thus spoke,\nshe would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed\nher:\n“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the sub-\nject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have\nnow given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present,\nbecause I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a\nman on the ﬁrst application, and perhaps you have even now said as\nmuch to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true deli-\ncacy of the female character.”\n“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puz-\nzle me exceedingly.",
    "If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in\nthe form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in\nsuch a way as to convince you of its being one.”\n“You must give me leave to ﬂatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\nrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course.",
    "My reasons for be-\nlieving it are brieﬂy these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\nunworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\nbe any other than highly desirable.",
    "My situation in life, my connec-\ntions with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own,\nare circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into\nfurther consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by\nno means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.",
    "Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the\neffects of your loveliness and amiable qualiﬁcations.",
    "As I must there-\nfore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall\nchoose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense,\naccording to the usual practice of elegant females.”\n“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that\nkind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.",
    "I\nwould rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.",
    "I thank\nyou again and again for the honour you have done me in your propos-\nals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.",
    "My feelings in every\nrespect forbid it.",
    "Can I speak plainer?",
    "Do not consider me now as\nan elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature,\nspeaking the truth from her heart.”\n77\n“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\ngallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\nbeing acceptable.”\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\nmake no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined,\nif he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as ﬂattering encour-\nagement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in\nsuch a manner as to be decisive, and whose behavior at least could not\nbe mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.",
    "Chapter 20\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his suc-\ncessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open\nthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself\nin warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection.",
    "Mr.\nCollins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure,\nand then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the\nresult of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisﬁed, since\nthe refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would natu-\nrally ﬂow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her\ncharacter.",
    "This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have\nbeen glad to be equally satisﬁed that her daughter had meant to en-\ncourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not be-\nlieve it, and could not help saying so.",
    "“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\nbrought to reason.",
    "I will speak to her about it directly.",
    "She is a very\nheadstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will\nmake her know it.”\n“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but\nif she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who natu-\nrally looks for happiness in the marriage state.",
    "If therefore she actually\npersists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into\naccepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\ncontribute much to my felicity.”\n78\n“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.",
    "“Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.",
    "In everything else\nshe is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.",
    "I will go directly to Mr.\nBennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh!",
    "Mr. Bennet, you\nare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.",
    "You must come and\nmake Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and\nif you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.”\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and ﬁxed\nthem on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least\naltered by her communication.",
    "“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she\nhad ﬁnished her speech.",
    "“Of what are you talking?”\n“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.",
    "Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\nCollins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”\n“And what am I to do on the occasion?",
    "It seems an hopeless busi-\nness.”\n“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.",
    "Tell her that you insist upon her\nmarrying him.”\n“Let her be called down.",
    "She shall hear my opinion.”\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to\nthe library.",
    "“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.",
    "“I have sent\nfor you on an affair of importance.",
    "I understand that Mr. Collins has\nmade you an offer of marriage.",
    "Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it\nwas.",
    "“Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?”\n“I have, sir.”\n“Very well.",
    "We now come to the point.",
    "Your mother insists upon\nyour accepting it.",
    "Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\n“Yes, or I will never see her again.”\n“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.",
    "From this day\nyou must be a stranger to one of your parents.",
    "Your mother will never\nsee you again if you do notmarry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you\nagain if you do.”\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a begin-\nning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband\nregarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.",
    "“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?",
    "You promised\nme to insist upon her marrying him.”\n79\n“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to re-\nquest.",
    "First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding\non the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.",
    "I shall be glad to\nhave the library to myself as soon as may be.”\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\ndid Mrs. Bennet give up the point.",
    "She talked to Elizabeth again and\nagain; coaxed and threatened her by turns.",
    "She endeavoured to secure\nJane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined inter-\nfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes\nwith playful gaiety, replied to her attacks.",
    "Though her manner varied,\nhowever, her determination never did.",
    "Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\npassed.",
    "He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what mo-\ntives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he\nsuffered in no other way.",
    "His regard for her was quite imaginary; and\nthe possibility of her deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his\nfeeling any regret.",
    "While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\nspend the day with them.",
    "She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who,\nﬂying to her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there\nis such fun here!",
    "What do you think has happened this morning?",
    "Mr.\nCollins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\nKitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered\nthe breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise\nbegan on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and\nentreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes\nof all her family.",
    "“Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melan-\ncholy tone, “for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me.",
    "I\nam cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.”\nCharlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.",
    "“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as uncon-\ncerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York,\nprovided she can have her own way.",
    "But I tell you, Miss Lizzy—if you\ntake it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this\nway, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know\nwho is to maintain you when your father is dead.",
    "I shall not be able\nto keep you—and so I warn you.",
    "I have done with you from this very\nday.",
    "I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to\nyou again, and you will ﬁnd me as good as my word.",
    "I have no plea-\nsure in talking to undutiful children.",
    "Not that I have much pleasure,\n80\nindeed, in talking to anybody.",
    "People who suffer as I do from nervous\ncomplaints can have no great inclination for talking.",
    "Nobody can tell\nwhat I suffer!",
    "But it is always so.",
    "Those who do not complain are never\npitied.”\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\nattempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irrita-\ntion.",
    "She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them,\ntill they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air\nmore stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,\n“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\nlet me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.”\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed,\nbut Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and\nCharlotte, detained ﬁrst by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries\nafter herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\ncuriosity, satisﬁed herself with walking to the window and pretending\nnot to hear.",
    "In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conver-\nsation: “Oh!",
    "Mr. Collins!”\n“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this\npoint.",
    "Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that\nmarked his displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter.",
    "Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the peculiar\nduty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early\npreferment; and I trust I am resigned.",
    "Perhaps not the less so from\nfeeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured\nme with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never\nso perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its\nvalue in our estimation.",
    "You will not, I hope, consider me as showing\nany disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing\nmy pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without having paid your-\nself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your\nauthority in my behalf.",
    "My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in hav-\ning accepted my dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your\nown.",
    "But we are all liable to error.",
    "I have certainly meant well through\nthe whole affair.",
    "My object has been to secure an amiable companion\nfor myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your fam-\nily, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\napologise.”\n81\nChapter 21\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings neces-\nsarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of\nher mother.",
    "As for the gentleman himself, hisfeelings were chieﬂy ex-\npressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,\nbut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.",
    "He scarcely ever spoke\nto her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and es-\npecially to her friend.",
    "The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour\nor ill health.",
    "Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.",
    "Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but\nhis plan did not appear in the least affected by it.",
    "He was always to\nhave gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.",
    "After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wick-\nham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Nether-\nﬁeld ball.",
    "He joined them on their entering the town, and attended\nthem to their aunt’s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of\neverybody, was well talked over.",
    "To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily\nacknowledged that the necessity of his absence hadbeen self-imposed.",
    "“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet\nMr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\nfull discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly\nbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another ofﬁcer walked back\nwith them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended\nto her.",
    "His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all\nthe compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.",
    "Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it\ncame from Netherﬁeld.",
    "The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, lit-\ntle, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, ﬂowing hand;\nand Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she read it, and\nsaw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.",
    "Jane recol-\nlected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her\nusual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an\n82\nanxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wick-\nham; and no sooner had he and he companion taken leave, than a\nglance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs.",
    "When they had\ngained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:\n“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me\na good deal.",
    "The whole party have left Netherﬁeld by this time, and\nare on their way to town—and without any intention of coming back\nagain.",
    "You shall hear what she says.”\nShe then read the ﬁrst sentence aloud, which comprised the infor-\nmation of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town\ndirectly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\nHurst had a house.",
    "The next was in these words: “I do not pretend\nto regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society,\nmy dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy\nmany returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in\nthe meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent\nand most unreserved correspondence.",
    "I depend on you for that.” To\nthese highﬂown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibil-\nity of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised\nher, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed\nthat their absence from Netherﬁeld would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being\nthere; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane\nmust cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.",
    "“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country.",
    "But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful in-\ntercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters?",
    "Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.”\n“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\nHertfordshire this winter.",
    "I will read it to you:”\n“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the busi-\nness which took him to London might be concluded in three or four\ndays; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time con-\nvinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it\nagain, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not\nbe obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.",
    "Many of\nmy acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could\nhear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of\nthe crowd—but of that I despair.",
    "I sincerely hope your Christmas in\n83\nHertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally\nbrings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your\nfeeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.”\n“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more\nthis winter.”\n“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should .”\n“Why will you think so?",
    "It must be his own doing.",
    "He is his own\nmaster.",
    "But you do not know all.",
    "Iwillread you the passage which\nparticularly hurts me.",
    "I will have no reserves from you.”\n“Mr.",
    "Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,\nweare scarcely less eager to meet her again.",
    "I really do not think Geor-\ngiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;\nand the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of\nher being hereafter our sister.",
    "I do not know whether I ever before\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the\ncountry without conﬁding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable.",
    "My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;\nher relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sis-\nter’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman’s heart.",
    "With all these circumstances\nto favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my\ndearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the\nhappiness of so many?”\n“What do you think of thissentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as\nshe ﬁnished it.",
    "“Is it not clear enough?",
    "Does it not expressly declare\nthat Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\nis perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she sus-\npects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!)",
    "to\nput me on my guard?",
    "Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”\n“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.",
    "Will you hear it?”\n“Most willingly.”\n“You shall have it in a few words.",
    "Miss Bingley sees that her brother\nis in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.",
    "She follows\nhim to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you\nthat he does not care about you.”\nJane shook her head.",
    "“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.",
    "No one who has ever seen\nyou together can doubt his affection.",
    "Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot.",
    "She is not such a simpleton.",
    "Could she have seen half as much love\n84\nin Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.",
    "But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them;\nand she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from\nthe notion that when there has been oneintermarriage, she may have\nless trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some\ningenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out\nof the way.",
    "But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that\nbecause Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy,\nhe is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he\ntook leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade\nhim that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with\nher friend.”\n“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your represen-\ntation of all this might make me quite easy.",
    "But I know the foundation\nis unjust.",
    "Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all\nthat I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.”\n“That is right.",
    "You could not have started a more happy idea, since\nyou will not take comfort in mine.",
    "Believe her to be deceived, by all\nmeans.",
    "You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”\n“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?”\n“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon ma-\nture deliberation, you ﬁnd that the misery of disobliging his two sisters\nis more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you\nby all means to refuse him.”\n“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling.",
    "“You must know\nthat though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I\ncould not hesitate.”\n“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot con-\nsider your situation with much compassion.”\n“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be re-\nquired.",
    "A thousand things may arise in six months!”\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the ut-\nmost contempt.",
    "It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could inﬂuence a young\nman so totally independent of everyone.",
    "She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.",
    "Jane’s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\n85\nthough the difﬁdence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\nBingley would return to Netherﬁeld and answer every wish of her\nheart.",
    "They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of\nthe family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s con-\nduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of con-\ncern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should\nhappen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.",
    "After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation\nthat Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Long-\nbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that\nthough he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\ncare to have two full courses.",
    "Chapter 22\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again dur-\ning the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.\nCollins.",
    "Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.",
    "“It keeps him\nin good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can\nexpress.” Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being use-\nful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacriﬁce of her time.",
    "This\nwas very amiable, but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Eliz-\nabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure\nher from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them to-\nwards herself.",
    "Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were\nso favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt al-\nmost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so\nvery soon.",
    "But here she did injustice to the ﬁre and independence of\nhis character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\nhimself at her feet.",
    "He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to con-\njecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\ntill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost se-\ncure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\nhe was comparatively difﬁdent since the adventure of Wednesday.",
    "His\nreception, however, was of the most ﬂattering kind.",
    "Miss Lucas per-\nceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house,\nand instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.",
    "But little had\n86\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.",
    "In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow, every-\nthing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they\nentered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was\nto make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to triﬂe with his\nhappiness.",
    "The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish\nfor its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the\npure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon\nthat establishment were gained.",
    "Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their con-\nsent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.",
    "Mr. Collins’s\npresent circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daugh-\nter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future\nwealth were exceedingly fair.",
    "Lady Lucas began directly to calculate,\nwith more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many\nyears longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his\ndecided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of\nthe Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\nhis wife should make their appearance at St. James’s.",
    "The whole fam-\nily, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.",
    "The younger\ngirls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might\notherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehen-\nsion of Charlotte’s dying an old maid.",
    "Charlotte herself was tolerably\ncomposed.",
    "She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.",
    "Her reﬂections were in general satisfactory.",
    "Mr. Collins, to be sure,\nwas neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\nattachment to her must be imaginary.",
    "But still he would be her hus-\nband.",
    "Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage\nhad always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated\nyoung women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving hap-\npiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.",
    "This preser-\nvative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without\nhaving ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.",
    "The least\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occa-\nsion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of\nany other person.",
    "Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame\nher; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must\nbe hurt by such a disapprobation.",
    "She resolved to give her the infor-\nmation herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to\n87\nLongbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any\nof the family.",
    "A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given,\nbut it could not be kept without difﬁculty; for the curiosity excited by\nhis long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return\nas required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time ex-\nercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous\nlove.",
    "As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any\nof the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the\nladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\ncordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn\nagain, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.",
    "“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly grat-\nifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may\nbe very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.”\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means\nwish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\n“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here,\nmy good sir?",
    "You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\noffending your patroness.”\n“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins,“ I am particularly obliged to you\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\nmaterial a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”\n“You cannot be too much upon your guard.",
    "Risk anything rather\nthan her displeasure; and if you ﬁnd it likely to be raised by your com-\ning to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly\nat home, and be satisﬁed that weshall take no offence.”\n“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\naffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\nregard during my stay in Hertfordshire.",
    "As for my fair cousins, though\nmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\ntake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\nmy cousin Elizabeth.”\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\nsurprised that he meditated a quick return.",
    "Mrs. Bennet wished to\nunderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\nyounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.",
    "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\na solidity in his reﬂections which often struck her, and though by no\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and\n88\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\nagreeable companion.",
    "But on the following morning, every hope of\nthis kind was done away.",
    "Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in\na private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.",
    "The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying herself in love with her\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possi-\nbility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\nconsequently so great as to overcome at ﬁrst the bounds of decorum,\nand she could not help crying out:\n“Engaged to Mr. Collins!",
    "My dear Charlotte—impossible!”\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in\ntelling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving\nso direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she\nsoon regained her composure, and calmly replied:\n“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?",
    "Do you think it in-\ncredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good\nopinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong ef-\nfort for it, was able to assure with tolerable ﬁrmness that the prospect\nof their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\nall imaginable happiness.",
    "“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte.",
    "“You must be sur-\nprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to\nmarry you.",
    "But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you\nwill be satisﬁed with what I have done.",
    "I am not romantic, you know;\nI never was.",
    "I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.\nCollins’s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced\nthat my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can\nboast on entering the marriage state.”\nElizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward\npause, they returned to the rest of the family.",
    "Charlotte did not stay\nmuch longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reﬂect on what she had\nheard.",
    "It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the\nidea of so unsuitable a match.",
    "The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making\ntwo offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of\nhis being now accepted.",
    "She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of\nmatrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it\nto be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacriﬁced\nevery better feeling to worldly advantage.",
    "Charlotte the wife of Mr.\nCollins was a most humiliating picture!",
    "And to the pang of a friend\n89\ndisgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing\nconviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy\nin the lot she had chosen.",
    "Chapter 23\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reﬂecting on\nwhat she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to men-\ntion it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter,\nto announce her engagement to the family.",
    "With many compliments\nto them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection be-\ntween the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an audience not merely\nwondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance\nthan politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, al-\nways unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\n“Good Lord!",
    "Sir William, how can you tell such a story?",
    "Do not\nyou know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.",
    "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so un-\npleasant a situation, now put herself forward to conﬁrm his account,\nby mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sis-\nters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which\nshe was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks\non the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent\ncharacter of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from\nLondon.",
    "Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal\nwhile Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her\nfeelings found a rapid vent.",
    "In the ﬁrst place, she persisted in disbe-\nlieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.\nCollins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never\nbe happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.",
    "Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one,\nthat Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she\nherself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two\n90\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.",
    "Nothing could\nconsole and nothing could appease her.",
    "Nor did that day wear out\nher resentment.",
    "A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth with-\nout scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir\nWilliam or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were\ngone before she could at all forgive their daughter.",
    "Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,\nand such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agree-\nable sort; for it gratiﬁed him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas,\nwhom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as\nhis wife, and more foolish than his daughter!",
    "Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.",
    "Kitty\nand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only\na clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of\nnews to spread at Meryton.",
    "Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to re-\ntort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married;\nand she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how\nhappy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured re-\nmarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.",
    "Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept\nthem mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that\nno real conﬁdence could ever subsist between them again.",
    "Her disap-\npointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister,\nof whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never\nbe shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\nBingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his\nreturn.",
    "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\ncounting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.",
    "The\npromised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, ad-\ndressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude\nwhich a twelvemonth’s abode in the family might have prompted.",
    "Af-\nter discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform\nthem, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having ob-\ntained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then\nexplained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that\nhe had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again\nat Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fort-\n91\nnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his mar-\nriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he\ntrusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Char-\nlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.",
    "Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet.",
    "On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\ncomplain of it as her husband.",
    "It was very strange that he should come\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\nand exceedingly troublesome.",
    "She hated having visitors in the house\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\nmost disagreeable.",
    "Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and\nthey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\nabsence.",
    "Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.",
    "Day\nafter day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than\nthe report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more\nto Netherﬁeld the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\nfalsehood.",
    "Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—\nbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.",
    "Un-\nwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s happiness,\nand so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent\nits frequently occurring.",
    "The united efforts of his two unfeeling sis-\nters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\nDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared,\nfor the strength of his attachment.",
    "As for Jane, heranxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\npainful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of con-\ncealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was\nnever alluded to.",
    "But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did\nnot come back she would think herself very ill used.",
    "It needed all Jane’s\nsteady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.",
    "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\nﬁrst introduction.",
    "He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\nand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\nfrom a great deal of his company.",
    "The chief of every day was spent by\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in\n92\ntime to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.",
    "Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.",
    "The very mention of\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,\nand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.",
    "The sight\nof Miss Lucas was odious to her.",
    "As her successor in that house, she\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence.",
    "Whenever Charlotte came to\nsee them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession;\nand whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced\nthat they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn\nherself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were\ndead.",
    "She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.",
    "“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Char-\nlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced\nto make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!”\n“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.",
    "Let us hope\nfor better things.",
    "Let us ﬂatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead\nof making any answer, she went on as before.",
    "“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.",
    "If it was\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”\n“What should not you mind?”\n“I should not mind anything at all.”\n“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such in-\nsensibility.”\n“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail.",
    "How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from\none’s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.\nCollins too!",
    "Why should hehave it more than anybody else?”\n“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.",
    "Chapter 24\nMiss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.",
    "The very ﬁrst\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the\ncountry.",
    "Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\nrest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\nwriter, that could give her any comfort.",
    "Miss Darcy’s praise occupied\n93\nthe chief of it.",
    "Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her for-\nmer letter.",
    "She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\ninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans\nof the latter with regard to new furniture.",
    "Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all\nthis, heard it in silent indignation.",
    "Her heart was divided between con-\ncern for her sister, and resentment against all others.",
    "To Caroline’s as-\nsertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.",
    "That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had\never done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him,\nshe could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that\neasiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made\nhim the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacriﬁce of his\nown happiness to the caprice of their inclination.",
    "Had his own happi-\nness, however, been the only sacriﬁce, he might have been allowed to\nsport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister’s was\ninvolved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.",
    "It was a sub-\nject, in short, on which reﬂection would be long indulged, and must be\nunavailing.",
    "She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley’s\nregard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ inter-\nference; whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether\nit had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her\nopinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sis-\nter’s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.",
    "A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feel-\nings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together,\nafter a longer irritation than usual about Netherﬁeld and its master, she\ncould not help saying:\n“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!",
    "She\ncan have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reﬂections\non him.",
    "But I will not repine.",
    "It cannot last long.",
    "He will be forgot, and\nwe shall all be as we were before.”\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\nnothing.",
    "“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have\nno reason.",
    "He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\nacquaintance, but that is all.",
    "I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\nnothing to reproach him with.",
    "Thank God!",
    "I have not thatpain.",
    "A little\ntime, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better.”\n94\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort imme-\ndiately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and\nthat it has done no harm to anyone but myself.”\n“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good.",
    "Your\nsweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what\nto say to you.",
    "I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as\nyou deserve.”\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw\nback the praise on her sister’s warm affection.",
    "“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair.",
    "Youwish to think all the\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.",
    "I only want\nto think youperfect, and you set yourself against it.",
    "Do not be afraid\nof my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of\nuniversal good-will.",
    "You need not.",
    "There are few people whom I really\nlove, and still fewer of whom I think well.",
    "The more I see of the world,\nthe more am I dissatisﬁed with it; and every day conﬁrms my belief of\nthe inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence\nthat can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.",
    "I have met with\ntwo instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte’s\nmarriage.",
    "It is unaccountable!",
    "In every view it is unaccountable!”\n“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.",
    "They\nwill ruin your happiness.",
    "You do not make allowance enough for dif-\nference of situation and temper.",
    "Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability,\nand Charlotte’s steady, prudent character.",
    "Remember that she is one\nof a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\nready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like\nregard and esteem for our cousin.”\n“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one\nelse could be beneﬁted by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded\nthat Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart.",
    "My dear Jane, Mr. Collins\nis a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is,\nas well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman\nwho married him cannot have a proper way of thinking.",
    "You shall not\ndefend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.",
    "You shall not, for the sake\nof one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\nendeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selﬁshness is prudence,\nand insensibility of danger security for happiness.”\n“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,”\nreplied Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them\nhappy together.",
    "But enough of this.",
    "You alluded to something else.",
    "95\nYou mentioned twoinstances.",
    "I cannot misunderstand you, but I en-\ntreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame,\nand saying your opinion of him is sunk.",
    "We must not be so ready\nto fancy ourselves intentionally injured.",
    "We must not expect a lively\nyoung man to be always so guarded and circumspect.",
    "It is very often\nnothing but our own vanity that deceives us.",
    "Women fancy admiration\nmeans more than it does.”\n“And men take care that they should.”\n“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justiﬁed; but I have no idea\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”\n“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to de-\nsign,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make\nothers unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.",
    "Thought-\nlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of res-\nolution, will do the business.”\n“And do you impute it to either of those?”\n“Yes; to the last.",
    "But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\nI think of persons you esteem.",
    "Stop me whilst you can.”\n“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters inﬂuence him?”\n“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”\n“I cannot believe it.",
    "Why should they try to inﬂuence him?",
    "They\ncan only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other\nwoman can secure it.”\n“Your ﬁrst position is false.",
    "They may wish many things besides his\nhappiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money,\ngreat connections, and pride.”\n“Beyond a doubt, they dowish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied\nJane; “but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.",
    "They have known her much longer than they have known me; no won-\nder if they love her better.",
    "But, whatever may be their own wishes, it\nis very unlikely they should have opposed their brother’s.",
    "What sister\nwould think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\nobjectionable?",
    "If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\nto part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.",
    "By supposing such an\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me\nmost unhappy.",
    "Do not distress me by the idea.",
    "I am not ashamed of\nhaving been mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in compar-\nison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.",
    "Let me\ntake it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\n96\nBingley’s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.",
    "Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\nno more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not\naccount for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering\nit with less perplexity.",
    "Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of\nwhat she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been\nmerely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when\nhe saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was\nadmitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.",
    "Mrs.\nBennet’s best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the\nsummer.",
    "Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.",
    "“So, Lizzy,” said he one\nday, “your sister is crossed in love, I ﬁnd.",
    "I congratulate her.",
    "Next to\nbeing married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.",
    "It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among\nher companions.",
    "When is your turn to come?",
    "You will hardly bear to\nbe long outdone by Jane.",
    "Now is your time.",
    "Here are ofﬁcers enough\nin Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.",
    "Let Wick-\nham be your man.",
    "He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you cred-\nitably.”\n“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.",
    "We\nmust not all expect Jane’s good fortune.”\n“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever\nof that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will\nmake the most of it.”\nMr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the\ngloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of\nthe Longbourn family.",
    "They saw him often, and to his other recom-\nmendations was now added that of general unreserve.",
    "The whole of\nwhat Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that\nhe had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and pub-\nlicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they\nhad always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the\nmatter.",
    "Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might\nbe any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the soci-\nety of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody\nelse Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.",
    "97\nChapter 25\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Sat-\nurday.",
    "The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\nside, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason\nto hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would\nbe ﬁxed that was to make him the happiest of men.",
    "He took leave of\nhis relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished\nhis fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\nanother letter of thanks.",
    "On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiv-\ning her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christ-\nmas at Longbourn.",
    "Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man,\ngreatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.",
    "The\nNetherﬁeld ladies would have had difﬁculty in believing that a man\nwho lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could\nhave been so well-bred and agreeable.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner, who was several\nyears younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, in-\ntelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn\nnieces.",
    "Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a\nparticular regard.",
    "They had frequently been staying with her in town.",
    "The ﬁrst part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival was to dis-\ntribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.",
    "When this was\ndone she had a less active part to play.",
    "It became her turn to listen.",
    "Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.",
    "They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.",
    "Two of\nher girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was\nnothing in it.",
    "“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.\nBingley if she could.",
    "But Lizzy!",
    "Oh, sister!",
    "It is very hard to think that\nshe might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had it not been for\nher own perverseness.",
    "He made her an offer in this very room, and\nshe refused him.",
    "The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a\ndaughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just\nas much entailed as ever.",
    "The Lucases are very artful people indeed,\nsister.",
    "They are all for what they can get.",
    "I am sorry to say it of them,\nbut so it is.",
    "It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so\nin my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\nbefore anybody else.",
    "However, your coming just at this time is the\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of\n98\nlong sleeves.”\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given be-\nfore, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her,\nmade her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces,\nturned the conversation.",
    "When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the sub-\nject.",
    "“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she.",
    "“I am sorry it went off.",
    "But these things happen so often!",
    "A young\nman, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a\npretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so eas-\nily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”\n“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not\ndo for us.",
    "We do not suffer by accident .",
    "It does not often happen that\nthe interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent\nfortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with\nonly a few days before.”\n“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubt-\nful, so indeﬁnite, that it gives me very little idea.",
    "It is as often applied\nto feelings which arise from a half-hour’s acquaintance, as to a real,\nstrong attachment.",
    "Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley’s love?”\n“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.",
    "Every time\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable.",
    "At his own ball he\noffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and\nI spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.",
    "Could there\nbe ﬁner symptoms?",
    "Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”\n“Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.",
    "Poor Jane!",
    "I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may\nnot get over it immediately.",
    "It had better have happened to you, Lizzy;\nyou would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.",
    "But do you think she\nwould be prevailed upon to go back with us?",
    "Change of scene might\nbe of service—and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful\nas anything.”\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt per-\nsuaded of her sister’s ready acquiescence.",
    "“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard\nto this young man will inﬂuence her.",
    "We live in so different a part of\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we\ngo out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,\nunless he really comes to see her.”\n“And thatis quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\n99\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such\na part of London!",
    "My dear aunt, how could you think of it?",
    "Mr. Darcy\nmay perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\nwould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\nnever stirs without him.”\n“So much the better.",
    "I hope they will not meet at all.",
    "But does not\nJane correspond with his sister?",
    "Shewill not be able to help calling.”\n“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place\nthis point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\nhopeless.",
    "It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\nhis affection might be reanimated, and the inﬂuence of his friends suc-\ncessfully combated by the more natural inﬂuence of Jane’s attractions.",
    "Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as\nshe hoped by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother,\nshe might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger\nof seeing him.",
    "The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\nPhillipses, the Lucases, and the ofﬁcers, there was not a day without\nits engagement.",
    "Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the enter-\ntainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a\nfamily dinner.",
    "When the engagement was for home, some of the ofﬁ-\ncers always made part of it—of which ofﬁcers Mr. Wickham was sure\nto be one; and on these occasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by\nElizabeth’s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both.",
    "With-\nout supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love,\ntheir preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little un-\neasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she\nleft Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging\nsuch an attachment.",
    "To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\nunconnected with his general powers.",
    "About ten or a dozen years ago,\nbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very\npart of Derbyshire to which he belonged.",
    "They had, therefore, many\nacquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there\nsince the death of Darcy’s father, it was yet in his power to give her\nfresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way\n100\nof procuring.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy\nby character perfectly well.",
    "Here consequently was an inexhaustible\nsubject of discourse.",
    "In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with\nthe minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing\nher tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was de-\nlighting both him and herself.",
    "On being made acquainted with the\npresent Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember some of\nthat gentleman’s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might\nagree with it, and was conﬁdent at last that she recollected having\nheard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-\nnatured boy.",
    "Chapter 26\nMrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\ngiven on the ﬁrst favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after\nhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:\n“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\nopenly.",
    "Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.",
    "Do not involve\nyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of\nfortune would make so very imprudent.",
    "I have nothing to say against\nhim; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\nought to have, I should think you could not do better.",
    "But as it is, you\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.",
    "You have sense, and we\nall expect you to use it.",
    "Your father would depend on your resolution\nand good conduct, I am sure.",
    "You must not disappoint your father.”\n“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\n“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\n“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.",
    "I will take care of\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too.",
    "He shall not be in love with me, if I\ncan prevent it.”\n“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”\n“I beg your pardon, I will try again.",
    "At present I am not in love\nwith Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.",
    "But he is, beyond all com-\nparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really\nattached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not.",
    "I see the\nimprudence of it.",
    "Oh!",
    "thatabominable Mr. Darcy!",
    "My father’s opinion\nof me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit\n101\nit.",
    "My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.",
    "In short, my dear\naunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you un-\nhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young\npeople are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from enter-\ning into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser\nthan so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even\nto know that it would be wisdom to resist?",
    "All that I can promise you,\ntherefore, is not to be in a hurry.",
    "I will not be in a hurry to believe\nmyself his ﬁrst object.",
    "When I am in company with him, I will not be\nwishing.",
    "In short, I will do my best.”\n“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\noften.",
    "At least, you should not remind you mother of inviting him.”\n“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\n“very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.",
    "But do not imagine\nthat he is always here so often.",
    "It is on your account that he has been\nso frequently invited this week.",
    "You know my mother’s ideas as to the\nnecessity of constant company for her friends.",
    "But really, and upon my\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope\nyou are satisﬁed.”\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\nher for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of\nadvice being given on such a point, without being resented.",
    "Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quit-\nted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lu-\ncases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet.",
    "His mar-\nriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned\nas to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured\ntone, that she “ wished they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the\nwedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit;\nand when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\naccompanied her out of the room.",
    "As they went downstairs together,\nCharlotte said:\n“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”\n“That you certainly shall.”\n“And I have another favour to ask you.",
    "Will you come and see me?”\n“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”\n“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.",
    "Promise me, therefore,\nto come to Hunsford.”\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\nvisit.",
    "102\n“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Char-\nlotte, “and I hope you will consent to be of the party.",
    "Indeed, Eliza,\nyou will be as welcome as either of them.”\nThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent\nfrom the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear,\non the subject as usual.",
    "Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and\ntheir correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been;\nthat it should be equally unreserved was impossible.",
    "Elizabeth could\nnever address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was\nover, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was\nfor the sake of what had been, rather than what was.",
    "Charlotte’s ﬁrst\nletters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but\nbe curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she\nwould like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce\nherself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that\nCharlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have\nforeseen.",
    "She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and\nmentioned nothing which she could not praise.",
    "The house, furniture,\nneighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s\nbehaviour was most friendly and obliging.",
    "It was Mr. Collins’s picture\nof Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived\nthat she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.",
    "Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.",
    "Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impa-\ntience generally is.",
    "Jane had been a week in town without either seeing\nor hearing from Caroline.",
    "She accounted for it, however, by supposing\nthat her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident\nbeen lost.",
    "“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the\ntown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\nBingley.",
    "“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she\nwas very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of\nmy coming to London.",
    "I was right, therefore, my last letter had never\nreached her.",
    "I inquired after their brother, of course.",
    "He was well, but\nso much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.",
    "I\nfound that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.",
    "I wish I could see her.",
    "My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.",
    "I\ndare say I shall see them soon here.”\n103\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter.",
    "It convinced her that ac-\ncident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.",
    "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.",
    "She en-\ndeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could\nno longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention.",
    "After waiting at home\nevery morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh ex-\ncuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay,\nand yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to de-\nceive herself no longer.",
    "The letter which she wrote on this occasion to\nher sister will prove what she felt.",
    "“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her\nbetter judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been\nentirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me.",
    "But, my dear sister,\nthough the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if\nI still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my conﬁdence\nwas as natural as your suspicion.",
    "I do not at all comprehend her reason\nfor wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were\nto happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.",
    "Caroline did not\nreturn my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive\nin the meantime.",
    "When she did come, it was very evident that she\nhad no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling\nbefore, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every\nrespect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly\nresolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.",
    "I pity, though I cannot\nhelp blaming her.",
    "She was very wrong in singling me out as she did;\nI can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side.",
    "But\nI pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and\nbecause I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.",
    "I need not explain myself farther; and though weknow this anxiety\nto be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her\nbehaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever\nanxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.",
    "I cannot but\nwonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had\nat all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.",
    "He knows of my\nbeing in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet\nit would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade\nherself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.",
    "I cannot understand it.",
    "If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to\nsay that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.",
    "But I will\nendeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will\nmake me happy—your affection, and the invariable kindness of my\n104\ndear uncle and aunt.",
    "Let me hear from you very soon.",
    "Miss Bingley\nsaid something of his never returning to Netherﬁeld again, of giving\nup the house, but not with any certainty.",
    "We had better not mention\nit.",
    "I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our\nfriends at Hunsford.",
    "Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.",
    "I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.”\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\nshe considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at\nleast.",
    "All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.",
    "She\nwould not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.",
    "His character\nsunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a\npossible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon\nmarry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s account, she would make\nhim abundantly regret what he had thrown away.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth\nhad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\nherself.",
    "His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\nhe was the admirer of some one else.",
    "Elizabeth was watchful enough\nto see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.",
    "Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisﬁed\nwith believing that shewould have been his only choice, had fortune\npermitted it.",
    "The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the\nmost remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now ren-\ndering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in\nthis case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of\nindependence.",
    "Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and\nwhile able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her,\nshe was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and\ncould very sincerely wish him happy.",
    "All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the\ncircumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt,\nthat I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that\npure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,\nand wish him all manner of evil.",
    "But my feelings are not only cordial\ntowards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King.",
    "I cannot ﬁnd\nout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a\nvery good sort of girl.",
    "There can be no love in all this.",
    "My watchfulness\nhas been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting\nobject to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him,\nI cannot say that I regret my comparative insigniﬁcance.",
    "Importance\n105\nmay sometimes be purchased too dearly.",
    "Kitty and Lydia take his de-\nfection much more to heart than I do.",
    "They are young in the ways of\nthe world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that hand-\nsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”\nChapter 27\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and oth-\nerwise diversiﬁed by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes\ndirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.",
    "March\nwas to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.",
    "She had not at ﬁrst thought very\nseriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depend-\ning on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with\ngreater pleasure as well as greater certainty.",
    "Absence had increased\nher desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.\nCollins.",
    "There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother\nand such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a lit-\ntle change was not unwelcome for its own sake.",
    "The journey would\nmoreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near,\nshe would have been very sorry for any delay.",
    "Everything, however,\nwent on smoothly, and was ﬁnally settled according to Charlotte’s ﬁrst\nsketch.",
    "She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.",
    "The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time,\nand the plan became perfect as plan could be.",
    "The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss\nher, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that\nhe told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.",
    "The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\nfriendly; on his side even more.",
    "His present pursuit could not make\nhim forget that Elizabeth had been the ﬁrst to excite and to deserve\nhis attention, the ﬁrst to listen and to pity, the ﬁrst to be admired; and\nin his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, re-\nminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\nand trusting their opinion of her—their opinion of everybody—would\nalways coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must\never attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from\nhim convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her\nmodel of the amiable and pleasing.",
    "Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\nthink him less agreeable.",
    "Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria,\n106\na good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing\nto say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as\nmuch delight as the rattle of the chaise.",
    "Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\nshe had known Sir William’s too long.",
    "He could tell her nothing new\nof the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities\nwere worn out, like his information.",
    "It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\nearly as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.",
    "As they drove to Mr.\nGardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their\narrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them,\nand Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it\nhealthful and lovely as ever.",
    "On the stairs were a troop of little boys\nand girls, whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not al-\nlow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had\nnot seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.",
    "All was\njoy and kindness.",
    "The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning\nin bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.",
    "Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.",
    "Their ﬁrst object was\nher sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply\nto her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support\nher spirits, there were periods of dejection.",
    "It was reasonable, however,\nto hope that they would not continue long.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner gave her\nthe particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\nacquaintance.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.",
    "“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King?",
    "I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”\n“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive?",
    "Where does discre-\ntion end, and avarice begin?",
    "Last Christmas you were afraid of his\nmarrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is\ntrying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to ﬁnd\nout that he is mercenary.”\n“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\nwhat to think.”\n“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.",
    "I know no harm of her.”\n“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s\ndeath made her mistress of this fortune.”\n107\n“No—what should he?",
    "If it were not allowable for him to gain my\naffections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\npoor?”\n“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards\nher so soon after this event.”\n“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those ele-\ngant decorums which other people may observe.",
    "If shedoes not object\nto it, why should we?”\n“Hernot objecting does not justify him.",
    "It only shows her being\ndeﬁcient in something herself—sense or feeling.”\n“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose.",
    "Heshall be merce-\nnary, and sheshall be foolish.”\n“No, Lizzy, that is what I do notchoose.",
    "I should be sorry, you\nknow, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”\n“Oh!",
    "if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\nlive in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire\nare not much better.",
    "I am sick of them all.",
    "Thank Heaven!",
    "I am going\nto-morrow where I shall ﬁnd a man who has not one agreeable quality,\nwho has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.",
    "Stupid men are\nthe only ones worth knowing, after all.”\n“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had\nthe unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and\naunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.",
    "“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gar-\ndiner, “but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.",
    "“Oh, my\ndear, dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight!",
    "what felic-\nity!",
    "You give me fresh life and vigour.",
    "Adieu to disappointment and\nspleen.",
    "What are young men to rocks and mountains?",
    "Oh!",
    "what hours\nof transport we shall spend!",
    "And when we doreturn, it shall not be\nlike other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of\nanything.",
    "We willknow where we have gone—we willrecollect what\nwe have seen.",
    "Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled to-\ngether in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any par-\nticular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation.",
    "Let\nourﬁrst effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of\ntravellers.”\n108\nChapter 28\nEvery object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen\nher sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the\nprospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.",
    "When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\nwas in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring\nit in view.",
    "The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one\nside.",
    "Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its\ninhabitants.",
    "At length the Parsonage was discernible.",
    "The garden sloping to the\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,\neverything declared they were arriving.",
    "Mr. Collins and Charlotte ap-\npeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\nthe whole party.",
    "In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoic-\ning at the sight of each other.",
    "Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with\nthe liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisﬁed with\ncoming when she found herself so affectionately received.",
    "She saw in-\nstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage; his\nformal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family.",
    "They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness\nof the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the\nparlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality\nto his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s offers of\nrefreshment.",
    "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\nhelp in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its\naspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.",
    "But though\neverything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify\nhim by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her\nfriend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.",
    "When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned\nher eye on Charlotte.",
    "Once or twice she could discern a faint blush;\nbut in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.",
    "After sitting long enough\nto admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard\nto the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\n109\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\ngarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\nwhich he attended himself.",
    "To work in this garden was one of his most\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of counte-\nnance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise,\nand owned she encouraged it as much as possible.",
    "Here, leading the\nway through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them\nan interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\nwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.",
    "He could num-\nber the ﬁelds in every direction, and could tell how many tress there\nwere in the most distant clump.",
    "But of all the views which his garden,\nor which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be com-\npared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees\nthat bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.",
    "It was a\nhandsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.",
    "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\nmeadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of\na white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him,\nCharlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well\npleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her\nhusband’s help.",
    "It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and\neverything was ﬁtted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency\nof which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.",
    "When Mr. Collins\ncould be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort through-\nout, and by Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he\nmust be often forgotten.",
    "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.",
    "It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins\njoining in, observed:\n“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not\nsay you will be delighted with her.",
    "She is all affability and condescen-\nsion, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of\nher notice when service is over.",
    "I have scarcely any hesitation in say-\ning she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with\nwhich she honours us during your stay here.",
    "Her behaviour to my\ndear Charlotte is charming.",
    "We dine at Rosings twice every week, and\nare never allowed to walk home.",
    "Her ladyship’s carriage is regularly\nordered for us.",
    "I should say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has\nseveral.”\n“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,”\n110\nadded Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\n“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.",
    "She is the sort of\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\nThe evening was spent chieﬂy in talking over Hertfordshire news,\nand telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Char-\nlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge\nthat it was all done very well.",
    "She had also to anticipate how her visit\nwould pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\nRosings.",
    "A lively imagination soon settled it all.",
    "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\nready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole\nhouse in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody\nrunning upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.",
    "She\nopened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless\nwith agitation, cried out—\n“Oh, my dear Eliza!",
    "pray make haste and come into the dining-\nroom, for there is such a sight to be seen!",
    "I will not tell you what it is.",
    "Make haste, and come down this moment.”\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\nmore, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane,\nin quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at\nthe garden gate.",
    "“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth.",
    "“I expected at least that the pigs\nwere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and\nher daughter.”\n“La!",
    "my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not\nLady Catherine.",
    "The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;\nthe other is Miss de Bourgh.",
    "Only look at her.",
    "She is quite a little crea-\nture.",
    "Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”\n“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this\nwind.",
    "Why does she not come in?”\n“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.",
    "It is the greatest of\nfavours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”\n“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.",
    "“She looks sickly and cross.",
    "Yes, she will do for him very well.",
    "She\nwill make him a very proper wife.”\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conver-\nsation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion,\n111\nwas stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the great-\nness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh\nlooked that way.",
    "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\nand the others returned into the house.",
    "Mr. Collins no sooner saw the\ntwo girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune,\nwhich Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party\nwas asked to dine at Rosings the next day.",
    "Chapter 29\nMr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was com-\nplete.",
    "The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his\nwondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself\nand his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportu-\nnity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\nCatherine’s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.",
    "“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by\nher ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening\nat Rosings.",
    "I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that\nit would happen.",
    "But who could have foreseen such an attention as\nthis?",
    "Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation\nto dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so\nimmediately after your arrival!”\n“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\n“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are,\nwhich my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.",
    "About the court,\nsuch instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but\ntheir visit to Rosings.",
    "Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in\nwhat they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many ser-\nvants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.",
    "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\nElizabeth—\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.",
    "Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\nbecomes herself and her daughter.",
    "I would advise you merely to put\non whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occa-\nsion for anything more.",
    "Lady Catherine will not think the worse of\nyou for being simply dressed.",
    "She likes to have the distinction of rank\n112\npreserved.”\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their dif-\nferent doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very\nmuch objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.",
    "Such formidable\naccounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened\nMaria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked for-\nward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her\nfather had done to his presentation at St. James’s.",
    "As the weather was ﬁne, they had a pleasant walk of about half\na mile across the park.",
    "Every park has its beauty and its prospects;\nand Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be\nin such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was\nbut slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.",
    "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was\nevery moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly\ncalm.",
    "Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her.",
    "She had heard nothing of\nLady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents\nor miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she\nthought she could witness without trepidation.",
    "From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\nrapturous air, the ﬁne proportion and the ﬁnished ornaments, they\nfollowed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where\nLady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.",
    "Her\nladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.\nCollins had settled it with her husband that the ofﬁce of introduction\nshould be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of\nthose apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.",
    "In spite of having been at St. James’s Sir William was so completely\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a\nword; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the\nedge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.",
    "Elizabeth found\nherself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies be-\nfore her composedly.",
    "Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with\nstrongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.",
    "Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them\nsuch as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.",
    "She was not ren-\ndered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so\nauthoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.\n113\nWickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and from the observation\nof the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what\nhe represented.",
    "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and de-\nportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned\nher eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s as-\ntonishment at her being so thin and so small.",
    "There was neither in\nﬁgure nor face any likeness between the ladies.",
    "Miss de Bourgh was\npale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insigniﬁcant; and\nshe spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose\nappearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely en-\ngaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper\ndirection before her eyes.",
    "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows\nto admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better\nworth looking at in the summer.",
    "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the ser-\nvants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and,\nas he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table,\nby her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could fur-\nnish nothing greater.",
    "He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\nalacrity; and every dish was commended, ﬁrst by him and then by Sir\nWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-\nlaw said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could\nbear.",
    "But Lady Catherine seemed gratiﬁed by their excessive admira-\ntion, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the\ntable proved a novelty to them.",
    "The party did not supply much con-\nversation.",
    "Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an open-\ning, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the\nformer of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the\nlatter said not a word to her all dinner-time.",
    "Mrs. Jenkinson was chieﬂy\nemployed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to\ntry some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.",
    "Maria thought\nspeaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat\nand admire.",
    "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\nbe done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every sub-\nject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have\nher judgement controverted.",
    "She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\n114\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to\nthe management of them all; told her how everything ought to be reg-\nulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of\nher cows and her poultry.",
    "Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath\nthis great lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of\ndictating to others.",
    "In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins,\nshe addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but espe-\ncially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who\nshe observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.",
    "She\nasked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they\nwere older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely\nto be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been ed-\nucated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s\nmaiden name?",
    "Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but\nanswered them very composedly.",
    "Lady Catherine then observed,\n“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.",
    "For your\nsake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line.",
    "It was not thought\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.",
    "Do you play and sing, Miss\nBennet?”\n“A little.”\n“Oh!",
    "then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.",
    "Our\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it\nsome day.",
    "Do your sisters play and sing?”\n“One of them does.”\n“Why did not you all learn?",
    "You ought all to have learned.",
    "The\nMiss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as\nyours.",
    "Do you draw?”\n“No, not at all.”\n“What, none of you?”\n“Not one.”\n“That is very strange.",
    "But I suppose you had no opportunity.",
    "Your\nmother should have taken you to town every spring for the beneﬁt of\nmasters.”\n“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates Lon-\ndon.”\n“Has your governess left you?”\n“We never had any governess.”\n“No governess!",
    "How was that possible?",
    "Five daughters brought\nup at home without a governess!",
    "I never heard of such a thing.",
    "Your\nmother must have been quite a slave to your education.”\n115\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not\nbeen the case.",
    "“Then, who taught you?",
    "who attended to you?",
    "Without a gov-\nerness, you must have been neglected.”\n“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\nwished to learn never wanted the means.",
    "We were always encouraged\nto read, and had all the masters that were necessary.",
    "Those who chose\nto be idle, certainly might.”\n“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I\nhad known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously\nto engage one.",
    "I always say that nothing is to be done in education\nwithout steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess\ncan give it.",
    "It is wonderful how many families I have been the means\nof supplying in that way.",
    "I am always glad to get a young person\nwell placed out.",
    "Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully\nsituated through my means; and it was but the other day that I rec-\nommended another young person, who was merely accidentally men-\ntioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.",
    "Mrs. Collins,\ndid I tell you of Lady Metcalf’s calling yesterday to thank me?",
    "She\nﬁnds Miss Pope a treasure.",
    "‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given\nme a treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\n“Yes, ma’am, all.”\n“All!",
    "What, all ﬁve out at once?",
    "Very odd!",
    "And you only the sec-\nond.",
    "The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!",
    "Your\nyounger sisters must be very young?”\n“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.",
    "Perhaps sheis full young to be\nmuch in company.",
    "But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard\nupon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society\nand amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclina-\ntion to marry early.",
    "The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures\nof youth at the ﬁrst.",
    "And to be kept back on such a motive!",
    "I think\nit would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of\nmind.”\n“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very\ndecidedly for so young a person.",
    "Pray, what is your age?”\n“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling,\n“your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\nanswer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the ﬁrst creature who\nhad ever dared to triﬂe with so much digniﬁed impertinence.",
    "“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not\n116\nconceal your age.”\n“I am not one-and-twenty.”\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-\ntables were placed.",
    "Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs.\nCollins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play\nat cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson\nto make up her party.",
    "Their table was superlatively stupid.",
    "Scarcely\na syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when\nMrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot\nor too cold, or having too much or too little light.",
    "A great deal more\npassed at the other table.",
    "Lady Catherine was generally speaking—\nstating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\nherself.",
    "Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her la-\ndyship said, thanking her for every ﬁsh he won, and apologising if\nhe thought he won too many.",
    "Sir William did not say much.",
    "He was\nstoring his memory with anecdotes and noble names.",
    "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as\nthey chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to\nMrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.",
    "The party\nthen gathered round the ﬁre to hear Lady Catherine determine what\nweather they were to have on the morrow.",
    "From these instructions they\nwere summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of\nthankfulness on Mr. Collins’s side and as many bows on Sir William’s\nthey departed.",
    "As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth\nwas called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen\nat Rosings, which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than\nit really was.",
    "But her commendation, though costing her some trouble,\ncould by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged\nto take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.",
    "Chapter 30\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long\nenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably set-\ntled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as\nwere not often met with.",
    "While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins\ndevoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him\nthe country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to\ntheir usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to ﬁnd that they\ndid not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the\n117\ntime between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at\nwork in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the\nwindow in his own book-room, which fronted the road.",
    "The room in\nwhich the ladies sat was backwards.",
    "Elizabeth had at ﬁrst rather won-\ndered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common\nuse; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but\nshe soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did,\nfor Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own\napartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte\ncredit for the arrangement.",
    "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,\nand were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages\nwent along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her\nphaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it\nhappened almost every day.",
    "She not unfrequently stopped at the Par-\nsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was\nscarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.",
    "Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Ros-\nings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go\nlikewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other fam-\nily livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacriﬁce of\nso many hours.",
    "Now and then they were honoured with a call from\nher ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in\nthe room during these visits.",
    "She examined into their employments,\nlooked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault\nwith the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in\nnegligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only\nfor the sake of ﬁnding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too\nlarge for her family.",
    "Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magis-\ntrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to\nher by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\nbe quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the vil-\nlage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them\ninto harmony and plenty.",
    "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a\nweek; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only\none card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the coun-\nterpart of the ﬁrst.",
    "Their other engagements were few, as the style of\nliving in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins’s reach.",
    "118\nThis, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent\nher time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant con-\nversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so ﬁne for the time of\nyear that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.",
    "Her favourite\nwalk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on\nLady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the\npark, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to\nvalue but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Cather-\nine’s curiosity.",
    "In this quiet way, the ﬁrst fortnight of her visit soon passed away.",
    "Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\nimportant.",
    "Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there\nwere not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his com-\ning would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings\nparties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bing-\nley’s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom\nhe was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his com-\ning with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest\nadmiration, and seemed almost angry to ﬁnd that he had already been\nfrequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.",
    "His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was\nwalking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into\nHunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and af-\nter making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home\nwith the great intelligence.",
    "On the following morning he hastened to\nRosings to pay his respects.",
    "There were two nephews of Lady Cather-\nine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel\nFitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ——, and, to the great\nsurprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman ac-\ncompanied him.",
    "Charlotte had seen them from her husband’s room,\ncrossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the\ngirls what an honour they might expect, adding:\n“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.",
    "Mr. Darcy would\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly af-\nterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.",
    "Colonel Fitzwilliam,\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and ad-\ndress most truly the gentleman.",
    "Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\n119\nused to look in Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward\nher friend, met her with every appearance of composure.",
    "Elizabeth\nmerely curtseyed to him without saying a word.",
    "Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house\nand garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any-\nbody.",
    "At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to in-\nquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.",
    "She answered him in\nthe usual way, and after a moment’s pause, added:\n“My eldest sister has been in town these three months.",
    "Have you\nnever happened to see her there?”\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\nsee whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed\nbetween the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little con-\nfused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet\nMiss Bennet.",
    "The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen\nsoon afterwards went away.",
    "Chapter 31\nColonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Par-\nsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the\npleasures of their engagements at Rosings.",
    "It was some days, how-\never, before they received any invitation thither—for while there were\nvisitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till\nEaster-day, almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were\nhonoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on\nleaving church to come there in the evening.",
    "For the last week they had\nseen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter.",
    "Colonel Fitzwilliam\nhad called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\nDarcy they had seen only at church.",
    "The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\njoined the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room.",
    "Her ladyship re-\nceived them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no\nmeans so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was,\nin fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially\nto Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.",
    "Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was\n120\na welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend\nhad moreover caught his fancy very much.",
    "He now seated himself\nby her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travel-\nling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had\nnever been half so well entertained in that room before; and they con-\nversed with so much spirit and ﬂow, as to draw the attention of Lady\nCatherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.",
    "Hiseyes had been soon and\nrepeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her\nladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowl-\nedged, for she did not scruple to call out:\n“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?",
    "What is it you are talking\nof?",
    "What are you telling Miss Bennet?",
    "Let me hear what it is.”\n“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able\nto avoid a reply.",
    "“Of music!",
    "Then pray speak aloud.",
    "It is of all subjects my delight.",
    "I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of mu-\nsic.",
    "There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true\nenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.",
    "If I had ever\nlearnt, I should have been a great proﬁcient.",
    "And so would Anne, if\nher health had allowed her to apply.",
    "I am conﬁdent that she would\nhave performed delightfully.",
    "How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proﬁciency.",
    "“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady\nCatherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel\nif she does not practice a good deal.”\n“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such\nadvice.",
    "She practises very constantly.”\n“So much the better.",
    "It cannot be done too much; and when I next\nwrite to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.",
    "I often\ntell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired with-\nout constant practice.",
    "I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she\nwill never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\nJenkinson’s room.",
    "She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that\npart of the house.”\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and\nmade no answer.",
    "When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of\nhaving promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the in-\nstrument.",
    "He drew a chair near her.",
    "Lady Catherine listened to half\n121\na song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the lat-\nter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation to-\nwards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view\nof the fair performer’s countenance.",
    "Elizabeth saw what he was doing,\nand at the ﬁrst convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile,\nand said:\n“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to\nhear me?",
    "I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well.",
    "There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened\nat the will of others.",
    "My courage always rises at every attempt to in-\ntimidate me.”\n“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could\nnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that\nyou ﬁnd great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in\nfact are not your own.”\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\nColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion\nof me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.",
    "I am particularly un-\nlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in\na part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some\ndegree of credit.",
    "Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to\nmention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and,\ngive me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to re-\ntaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to\nhear.”\n“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.",
    "“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\nFitzwilliam.",
    "“I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”\n“You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very\ndreadful.",
    "The ﬁrst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you\nmust know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did?",
    "He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to\nmy certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in\nwant of a partner.",
    "Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”\n“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the as-\nsembly beyond my own party.”\n“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.",
    "Well,\nColonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?",
    "My ﬁngers wait your or-\nders.”\n“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought\n122\nan introduction; but I am ill-qualiﬁed to recommend myself to\nstrangers.”\n“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.",
    "“Shall we ask him why a man of sense\nand education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualiﬁed to rec-\nommend himself to strangers?”\n“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying\nto him.",
    "It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”\n“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said\nDarcy, “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.",
    "I\ncannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\nconcerns, as I often see done.”\n“My ﬁngers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in\nthe masterly manner which I see so many women’s do.",
    "They have not\nthe same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.",
    "But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will\nnot take the trouble of practising.",
    "It is not that I do not believe my\nﬁngers as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”\nDarcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right.",
    "You have em-\nployed your time much better.",
    "No one admitted to the privilege of\nhearing you can think anything wanting.",
    "We neither of us perform to\nstrangers.”\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\nknow what they were talking of.",
    "Elizabeth immediately began play-\ning again.",
    "Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few\nminutes, said to Darcy:\n“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\ncould have the advantage of a London master.",
    "She has a very good no-\ntion of ﬁngering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s.",
    "Anne would\nhave been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\ncousin’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour\nto Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he\nmight have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.",
    "Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance,\nmixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.",
    "Elizabeth\nreceived them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of\nthe gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage\nwas ready to take them all home.",
    "123\nChapter 32\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\nJane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the vil-\nlage, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal\nof a visitor.",
    "As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely\nto be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away\nher half-ﬁnished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\nwhen the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and\nMr. Darcy only, entered the room.",
    "He seemed astonished too on ﬁnding her alone, and apologised for\nhis intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies\nwere to be within.",
    "They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were\nmade, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.",
    "It was absolutely\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence rec-\nollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curi-\nous to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure,\nshe observed:\n“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherﬁeld last November,\nMr. Darcy!",
    "It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley\nto see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but\nthe day before.",
    "He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left\nLondon?”\n“Perfectly so, I thank you.”\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short\npause added:\n“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\never returning to Netherﬁeld again?”\n“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\nvery little of his time there in the future.",
    "He has many friends, and is\nat a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increas-\ning.”\n“If he means to be but little at Netherﬁeld, it would be better for the\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\nmight possibly get a settled family there.",
    "But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood\nas for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same\nprinciple.”\n“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.”\n124\nElizabeth made no answer.",
    "She was afraid of talking longer of his\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave\nthe trouble of ﬁnding a subject to him.",
    "He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfort-\nable house.",
    "Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\nCollins ﬁrst came to Hunsford.”\n“I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\nkindness on a more grateful object.”\n“Mr.",
    "Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”\n“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\none of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him,\nor have made him happy if they had.",
    "My friend has an excellent\nunderstanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying\nMr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.",
    "She seems perfectly happy,\nhowever, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for\nher.”\n“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\ndistance of her own family and friends.”\n“An easy distance, do you call it?",
    "It is nearly ﬁfty miles.”\n“And what is ﬁfty miles of good road?",
    "Little more than half a day’s\njourney.",
    "Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”\n“I should never have considered the distance as one of the advan-\ntages of the match,” cried Elizabeth.",
    "“I should never have said Mrs.\nCollins was settled near her family.”\n“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.",
    "Anything\nbeyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would ap-\npear far.”\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\nNetherﬁeld, and she blushed as she answered:\n“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\nher family.",
    "The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\nvarying circumstances.",
    "Where there is fortune to make the expenses\nof travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.",
    "But that is not\nthe case here.",
    "Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my\nfriend would not call herself near her family under less than halfthe\npresent distance.”\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “ Youcannot\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment.",
    "Youcannot have been\nalways at Longbourn.”\n125\nElizabeth looked surprised.",
    "The gentleman experienced some\nchange of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the\ntable, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\n“Are you pleased with Kent?”\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\ncalm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\nand her sister, just returned from her walk.",
    "The tete-a-tete surprised\nthem.",
    "Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intrud-\ning on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without say-\ning much to anybody, went away.",
    "“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he\nwas gone.",
    "“My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would\nnever have called us in this familiar way.”\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely,\neven to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures,\nthey could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difﬁculty\nof ﬁnding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time\nof year.",
    "All ﬁeld sports were over.",
    "Within doors there was Lady Cather-\nine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within\ndoors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the\nwalk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\ntemptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.",
    "They\ncalled at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, some-\ntimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.",
    "It was\nplain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had plea-\nsure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him\nstill more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in be-\ning with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former\nfavourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\nthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners,\nshe believed he might have the best informed mind.",
    "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\ndifﬁcult to understand.",
    "It could not be for society, as he frequently\nsat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he\ndid speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a\nsacriﬁce to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.",
    "He seldom appeared\nreally animated.",
    "Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.",
    "Colonel\nFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have\ntold her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\nof love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seri-\n126\nously to work to ﬁnd it out.",
    "She watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much suc-\ncess.",
    "He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression\nof that look was disputable.",
    "It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she\noften doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and some-\ntimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.",
    "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in\nher opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike\nwould vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.",
    "In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her mar-\nrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.",
    "He was beyond comparison the most pleas-\nant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most\neligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had con-\nsiderable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at\nall.",
    "Chapter 33\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unex-\npectedly meet Mr. Darcy.",
    "She felt all the perverseness of the mischance\nthat should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent\nits ever happening again, took care to inform him at ﬁrst that it was\na favourite haunt of hers.",
    "How it could occur a second time, there-\nfore, was very odd!",
    "Yet it did, and even a third.",
    "It seemed like wilful\nill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not\nmerely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.",
    "He\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or\nof listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre\nthat he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her plea-\nsure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion\nof Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings\nand her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect\nthat whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there\ntoo.",
    "His words seemed to imply it.",
    "Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam\nin his thoughts?",
    "She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean\nan allusion to what might arise in that quarter.",
    "It distressed her a little,\n127\nand she was quite glad to ﬁnd herself at the gate in the pales opposite\nthe Parsonage.",
    "She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had\nnot written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.\nDarcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting\nher.",
    "Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:\n“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\n“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I gener-\nally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.",
    "Are you going much farther?”\n“No, I should have turned in a moment.”\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Par-\nsonage together.",
    "“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.",
    "“Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again.",
    "But I am at his disposal.",
    "He arranges the business just as he pleases.”\n“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\nleast pleasure in the great power of choice.",
    "I do not know anybody\nwho seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.\nDarcy.”\n“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel\nFitzwilliam.",
    "“But so we all do.",
    "It is only that he has better means\nof having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are\npoor.",
    "I speak feelingly.",
    "A younger son, you know, must be inured to\nself-denial and dependence.”\n“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\neither.",
    "Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and de-\npendence?",
    "When have you been prevented by want of money from go-\ning wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\n“These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have\nexperienced many hardships of that nature.",
    "But in matters of greater\nweight, I may suffer from want of money.",
    "Younger sons cannot marry\nwhere they like.”\n“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very\noften do.”\n“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too\nmany in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some atten-\ntion to money.”\n“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured\nat the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray,\n128\nwhat is the usual price of an earl’s younger son?",
    "Unless the elder\nbrother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above ﬁfty thou-\nsand pounds.”\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.",
    "To\ninterrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what\nhad passed, she soon afterwards said:\n“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chieﬂy for the\nsake of having someone at his disposal.",
    "I wonder he does not marry, to\nsecure a lasting convenience of that kind.",
    "But, perhaps, his sister does\nas well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do\nwhat he likes with her.”\n“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he\nmust divide with me.",
    "I am joined with him in the guardianship of\nMiss Darcy.”\n“Are you indeed?",
    "And pray what sort of guardians do you make?",
    "Does your charge give you much trouble?",
    "Young ladies of her age are\nsometimes a little difﬁcult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy\nspirit, she may like to have her own way.”\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\nmanner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss\nDarcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had\nsomehow or other got pretty near the truth.",
    "She directly replied:\n“You need not be frightened.",
    "I never heard any harm of her; and I\ndare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.",
    "She is a\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst\nand Miss Bingley.",
    "I think I have heard you say that you know them.”\n“I know them a little.",
    "Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\nman—he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\n“Oh!",
    "yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr.",
    "Darcy is uncommonly kind to\nMr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\n“Care of him!",
    "Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in\nthose points where he most wants care.",
    "From something that he told\nme in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much\nindebted to him.",
    "But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to\nsuppose that Bingley was the person meant.",
    "It was all conjecture.”\n“What is it you mean?”\n“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\nknown, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it would be\nan unpleasant thing.”\n“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\n“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to\n129\nbe Bingley.",
    "What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated\nhimself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a\nmost imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\nparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the\nkind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing\nthem to have been together the whole of last summer.”\n“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”\n“I understood that there were some very strong objections against\nthe lady.”\n“And what arts did he use to separate them?”\n“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling.",
    "“He only told me what I have now told you.”\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\nindignation.",
    "After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\nwas so thoughtful.",
    "“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she.",
    "“Your\ncousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings.",
    "Why was he to be the\njudge?”\n“You are rather disposed to call his interference ofﬁcious?”\n“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of\nhis friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was\nto determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.",
    "But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the par-\nticulars, it is not fair to condemn him.",
    "It is not to be supposed that there\nwas much affection in the case.”\n“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a\nlessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of\nMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and there-\nfore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters\nuntil they reached the Parsonage.",
    "There, shut into her own room, as\nsoon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of\nall that she had heard.",
    "It was not to be supposed that any other peo-\nple could be meant than those with whom she was connected.",
    "There\ncould not exist in the world twomen over whom Mr. Darcy could have\nsuch boundless inﬂuence.",
    "That he had been concerned in the measures\ntaken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\nalways attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrange-\nment of them.",
    "If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he\nwas the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane\nhad suffered, and still continued to suffer.",
    "He had ruined for a while\n130\nevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in\nthe world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\ninﬂicted.",
    "“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were\nColonel Fitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably\nwere, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another\nwho was in business in London.",
    "“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\nobjection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding\nexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.",
    "Neither\ncould anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\npeculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and re-\nspectability which he will probably never each.” When she thought of\nher mother, her conﬁdence gave way a little; but she would not allow\nthat any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the\nwant of importance in his friend’s connections, than from their want\nof sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly\ngoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retain-\ning Mr. Bingley for his sister.",
    "The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added\nto her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend\nher cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.",
    "Mrs.\nCollins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and\nas much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr.\nCollins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being\nrather displeased by her staying at home.",
    "Chapter 34\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate her-\nself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment\nthe examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\nbeing in Kent.",
    "They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.",
    "But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.",
    "Elizabeth\n131\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an at-\ntention which it had hardly received on the ﬁrst perusal.",
    "Mr. Darcy’s\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inﬂict, gave her a\nkeener sense of her sister’s sufferings.",
    "It was some consolation to think\nthat his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a\nstill greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane\nagain, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all\nthat affection could do.",
    "She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering\nthat his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made\nit clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she\ndid not mean to be unhappy about him.",
    "While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of\nthe door-bell, and her spirits were a little ﬂuttered by the idea of its\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\nthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.",
    "But\nthis idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently af-\nfected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\nroom.",
    "In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.",
    "She\nanswered him with cold civility.",
    "He sat down for a few moments, and\nthen getting up, walked about the room.",
    "Elizabeth was surprised, but\nsaid not a word.",
    "After a silence of several minutes, he came towards\nher in an agitated manner, and thus began:\n“In vain I have struggled.",
    "It will not do.",
    "My feelings will not be\nrepressed.",
    "You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and\nlove you.”\nElizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression.",
    "She stared,\ncoloured, doubted, and was silent.",
    "This he considered sufﬁcient en-\ncouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for\nher, immediately followed.",
    "He spoke well; but there were feelings be-\nsides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on\nthe subject of tenderness than of pride.",
    "His sense of her inferiority—\nof its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which had always\nopposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed\ndue to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\nrecommend his suit.",
    "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\nthe compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions\ndid not vary for an instant, she was at ﬁrst sorry for the pain he was\nto receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\n132\nlost all compassion in anger.",
    "She tried, however, to compose herself\nto answer him with patience, when he should have done.",
    "He con-\ncluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which,\nin spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and\nwith expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her accep-\ntance of his hand.",
    "As he said this, she could easily see that he had no\ndoubt of a favourable answer.",
    "He spoke of apprehension and anxiety,\nbut his countenance expressed real security.",
    "Such a circumstance could\nonly exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her\ncheeks, and she said:\n“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express\na sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally\nthey may be returned.",
    "It is natural that obligation should be felt, and\nif I could feelgratitude, I would now thank you.",
    "But I cannot—I have\nnever desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it\nmost unwillingly.",
    "I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.",
    "It has\nbeen most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short\nduration.",
    "The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the ac-\nknowledgment of your regard, can have little difﬁculty in overcoming\nit after this explanation.”\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes\nﬁxed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment\nthan surprise.",
    "His complexion became pale with anger, and the distur-\nbance of his mind was visible in every feature.",
    "He was struggling for\nthe appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he be-\nlieved himself to have attained it.",
    "The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\ndreadful.",
    "At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\n“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expect-\ning!",
    "I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour\nat civility, I am thus rejected.",
    "But it is of small importance.”\n“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a de-\nsire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked\nme against your will, against your reason, and even against your char-\nacter?",
    "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I wasuncivil?",
    "But I\nhave other provocations.",
    "You know I have.",
    "Had not my feelings de-\ncided against you—had they been indifferent, or had they even been\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to\naccept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever,\nthe happiness of a most beloved sister?”\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the\nemotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her\n133\nwhile she continued:\n“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.",
    "No motive\ncan excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there.",
    "You dare\nnot, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only\nmeans of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the cen-\nsure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its deri-\nsion for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the\nacutest kind.”\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listen-\ning with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of\nremorse.",
    "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.",
    "“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.",
    "With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of deny-\ning that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success.",
    "Towards himI have been kinder\nthan towards myself.”\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reﬂection,\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.",
    "“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dis-\nlike is founded.",
    "Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was\ndecided.",
    "Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham.",
    "On this subject, what can you\nhave to say?",
    "In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend\nyourself?",
    "or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon\nothers?”\n“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said\nDarcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.",
    "“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling\nan interest in him?”\n“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his mis-\nfortunes have been great indeed.”\n“And of your inﬂiction,” cried Elizabeth with energy.",
    "“You have re-\nduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty.",
    "You\nhave withheld the advantages which you must know to have been de-\nsigned for him.",
    "You have deprived the best years of his life of that\nindependence which was no less his due than his desert.",
    "You have\ndone all this!",
    "and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with\ncontempt and ridicule.”\n“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the\nroom, “is your opinion of me!",
    "This is the estimation in which you\nhold me!",
    "I thank you for explaining it so fully.",
    "My faults, according\n134\nto this calculation, are heavy indeed!",
    "But perhaps,” added he, stop-\nping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have\nbeen overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confes-\nsion of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious\ndesign.",
    "These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I,\nwith greater policy, concealed my struggles, and ﬂattered you into the\nbelief of my being impelled by unqualiﬁed, unalloyed inclination; by\nreason, by reﬂection, by everything.",
    "But disguise of every sort is my\nabhorrence.",
    "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.",
    "They were nat-\nural and just.",
    "Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\nconnections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose\ncondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\ntried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\n“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\ndeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared the concern\nwhich I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\ngentlemanlike manner.”\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\n“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\nway that would have tempted me to accept it.”\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortiﬁcation.",
    "She went on:\n“From the very beginning—from the ﬁrst moment, I may almost\nsay—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with\nthe fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selﬁsh dis-\ndain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\ndisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable\na dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were\nthe last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\n“You have said quite enough, madam.",
    "I perfectly comprehend your\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.",
    "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my\nbest wishes for your health and happiness.”\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard\nhim the next moment open the front door and quit the house.",
    "The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.",
    "She knew not\nhow to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried\nfor half-an-hour.",
    "Her astonishment, as she reﬂected on what had\npassed, was increased by every review of it.",
    "That she should receive\nan offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!",
    "That he should have been in\n135\nlove with her for so many months!",
    "So much in love as to wish to\nmarry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent\nhis friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with\nequal force in his own case—was almost incredible!",
    "It was gratifying to\nhave inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.",
    "But his pride, his\nabominable pride—his shameless avowal of what he had done with re-\nspect to Jane—his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though\nhe could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had men-\ntioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted\nto deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attach-\nment had for a moment excited.",
    "She continued in very agitated re-\nﬂections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how\nunequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her\naway to her room.",
    "Chapter 35\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and medi-\ntations which had at length closed her eyes.",
    "She could not yet recover\nfrom the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of\nanything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved,\nsoon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise.",
    "She was\nproceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.\nDarcy’s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering\nthe park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-\nroad.",
    "The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\npassed one of the gates into the ground.",
    "After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\nlook into the park.",
    "The ﬁve weeks which she had now passed in Kent\nhad made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding\nto the verdure of the early trees.",
    "She was on the point of continuing\nher walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort\nof grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful\nof its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.",
    "But the person who\nadvanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with\neagerness, pronounced her name.",
    "She had turned away; but on hear-\ning herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy,\nshe moved again towards the gate.",
    "He had by that time reached it also,\nand, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look\n136\nof haughty composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time\nin the hope of meeting you.",
    "Will you do me the honour of reading that\nletter?” And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation,\nand was soon out of sight.",
    "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, per-\nceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite\nthrough, in a very close hand.",
    "The envelope itself was likewise full.",
    "Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.",
    "It was dated from\nRosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:—\n“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehen-\nsion of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of\nthose offers which were last night so disgusting to you.",
    "I write with-\nout any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on\nwishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten;\nand the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must\noccasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it\nto be written and read.",
    "You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with\nwhich I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it\nunwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.",
    "“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\nmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge.",
    "The ﬁrst mentioned was,\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bin-\ngley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in deﬁance of vari-\nous claims, in deﬁance of honour and humanity, ruined the immedi-\nate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.",
    "Wilfully and\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowl-\nedged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to\nexpect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of\ntwo young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few\nweeks, could bear no comparison.",
    "But from the severity of that blame\nwhich was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circum-\nstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following\naccount of my actions and their motives has been read.",
    "If, in the ex-\nplanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of\nrelating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that\nI am sorry.",
    "The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would\nbe absurd.",
    "“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\nwith others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\n137\nwoman in the country.",
    "But it was not till the evening of the dance\nat Netherﬁeld that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious at-\ntachment.",
    "I had often seen him in love before.",
    "At that ball, while I\nhad the honour of dancing with you, I was ﬁrst made acquainted, by\nSir William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to\nyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.",
    "He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be un-\ndecided.",
    "From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour atten-\ntively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\nbeyond what I had ever witnessed in him.",
    "Your sister I also watched.",
    "Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but\nwithout any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\nfrom the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\nwith pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of senti-\nment.",
    "If youhave not been mistaken here, Imust have been in error.",
    "Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.",
    "If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inﬂict pain on her, your\nresentment has not been unreasonable.",
    "But I shall not scruple to assert,\nthat the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such as might\nhave given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable\nher temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.",
    "That I was de-\nsirous of believing her indifferent is certain—but I will venture to say\nthat my investigation and decisions are not usually inﬂuenced by my\nhopes or fears.",
    "I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished\nit; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in rea-\nson.",
    "My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\nnight acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside,\nin my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\nmy friend as to me.",
    "But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\nwhich, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both in-\nstances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not im-\nmediately before me.",
    "These causes must be stated, though brieﬂy.",
    "The\nsituation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing\nin comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\nuniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occa-\nsionally even by your father.",
    "Pardon me.",
    "It pains me to offend you.",
    "But\namidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your\ndispleasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to\nconsider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\nthe like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your\nelder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.",
    "138\nI will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion\nof all parties was conﬁrmed, and every inducement heightened which\ncould have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed\na most unhappy connection.",
    "He left Netherﬁeld for London, on the\nday following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\nreturning.",
    "“The part which I acted is now to be explained.",
    "His sisters’ uneasi-\nness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling\nwas soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in\ndetaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\nLondon.",
    "We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the of-\nﬁce of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice.",
    "I de-\nscribed, and enforced them earnestly.",
    "But, however this remonstrance\nmight have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\nseconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sis-\nter’s indifference.",
    "He had before believed her to return his affection\nwith sincere, if not with equal regard.",
    "But Bingley has great natural\nmodesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\nown.",
    "To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no\nvery difﬁcult point.",
    "To persuade him against returning into Hertford-\nshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a\nmoment.",
    "I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.",
    "There is\nbut one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reﬂect\nwith satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art\nso far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in town.",
    "I knew it my-\nself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet igno-\nrant of it.",
    "That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps\nprobable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for\nhim to see her without some danger.",
    "Perhaps this concealment, this\ndisguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the\nbest.",
    "On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to of-\nfer.",
    "If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done\nand though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally\nappear insufﬁcient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.",
    "“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having in-\njured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole\nof his connection with my family.",
    "Of what he has particularly accused\nme I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon\nmore than one witness of undoubted veracity.",
    "“Mr.",
    "Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\n139\nmany years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose\ngood conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my fa-\nther to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his\ngodson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.",
    "My father sup-\nported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most important\nassistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his\nwife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman’s education.",
    "My father was not only fond of this young man’s society, whose man-\nner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and\nhoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for\nhim in it.",
    "As for myself, it is many, many years since I ﬁrst began to\nthink of him in a very different manner.",
    "The vicious propensities—the\nwant of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge\nof his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man\nof nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of\nseeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.",
    "Here again shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell.",
    "But\nwhatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\nsuspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real\ncharacter—it adds even another motive.",
    "“My excellent father died about ﬁve years ago; and his attachment\nto Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly\nrecommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner\nthat his profession might allow—and if he took orders, desired that a\nvaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant.",
    "There\nwas also a legacy of one thousand pounds.",
    "His own father did not\nlong survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wick-\nham wrote to inform me that, having ﬁnally resolved against taking\norders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect\nsome more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment,\nby which he could not be beneﬁted.",
    "He had some intention, he added,\nof studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand\npounds would be a very insufﬁcient support therein.",
    "I rather wished,\nthan believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready\nto accede to his proposal.",
    "I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be\na clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all\nclaim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever\nbe in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand\npounds.",
    "All connection between us seemed now dissolved.",
    "I thought\ntoo ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.",
    "In town I believe he chieﬂy lived, but his studying the law was a mere\n140\npretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of\nidleness and dissipation.",
    "For about three years I heard little of him;\nbut on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been de-\nsigned for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.",
    "His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difﬁculty in believing\nit, were exceedingly bad.",
    "He had found the law a most unproﬁtable\nstudy, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would\npresent him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could\nbe little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to pro-\nvide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions.",
    "You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or\nfor resisting every repetition to it.",
    "His resentment was in proportion\nto the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent\nin his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.",
    "After this\nperiod every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.",
    "How he lived\nI know not.",
    "But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on\nmy notice.",
    "“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to for-\nget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should in-\nduce me to unfold to any human being.",
    "Having said thus much, I feel\nno doubt of your secrecy.",
    "My sister, who is more than ten years my\njunior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel\nFitzwilliam, and myself.",
    "About a year ago, she was taken from school,\nand an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she\nwent with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also\nwent Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have\nbeen a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose\ncharacter we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance\nand aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affec-\ntionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a\nchild, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent\nto an elopement.",
    "She was then but ﬁfteen, which must be her excuse;\nand after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the\nknowledge of it to herself.",
    "I joined them unexpectedly a day or two\nbefore the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support\nthe idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked\nup to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.",
    "You may imagine\nwhat I felt and how I acted.",
    "Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings\nprevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left\nthe place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from\nher charge.",
    "Mr. Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s\n141\nfortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing\nthat the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.",
    "His revenge would have been complete indeed.",
    "“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\nhave been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it\nas false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.\nWickham.",
    "I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood\nhe had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered\nat.",
    "Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,\ndetection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in\nyour inclination.",
    "“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night;\nbut I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or\nought to be revealed.",
    "For the truth of everything here related, I can\nappeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who,\nfrom our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as\none of the executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably ac-\nquainted with every particular of these transactions.",
    "If your abhor-\nrence of meshould make myassertions valueless, you cannot be pre-\nvented by the same cause from conﬁding in my cousin; and that there\nmay be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to ﬁnd some\nopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the\nmorning.",
    "I will only add, God bless you.",
    "“Fitzwilliam Darcy ”\nChapter 36\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it\nto contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at\nall of its contents.",
    "But such as they were, it may well be supposed\nhow eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emo-\ntion they excited.",
    "Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be deﬁned.",
    "With amazement did she ﬁrst understand that he believed any apology\nto be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could\nhave no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not\nconceal.",
    "With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she\nbegan his account of what had happened at Netherﬁeld.",
    "She read with\nan eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from\nimpatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was inca-\npable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.",
    "His belief\n142\nof her sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his\naccount of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too an-\ngry to have any wish of doing him justice.",
    "He expressed no regret for\nwhat he had done which satisﬁed her; his style was not penitent, but\nhaughty.",
    "It was all pride and insolence.",
    "But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\nWickham—when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation\nof events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of\nhis worth, and which bore so alarming an afﬁnity to his own history\nof himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more dif-\nﬁcult of deﬁnition.",
    "Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, op-\npressed her.",
    "She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaim-\ning, “This must be false!",
    "This cannot be!",
    "This must be the grossest\nfalsehood!”—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though\nscarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away,\nprotesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it\nagain.",
    "In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the let-\nter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sen-\ntence.",
    "The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was\nexactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.\nDarcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well\nwith his own words.",
    "So far each recital conﬁrmed the other; but when\nshe came to the will, the difference was great.",
    "What Wickham had\nsaid of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very\nwords, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on\none side or the other; and, for a few moments, she ﬂattered herself that\nher wishes did not err.",
    "But when she read and re-read with the closest\nattention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resign-\ning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable\na sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.",
    "She\nput down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant\nto be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—\nbut with little success.",
    "On both sides it was only assertion.",
    "Again she\nread on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she\nhad believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as\nto render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of\na turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.",
    "143\nThe extravagance and general proﬂigacy which he scrupled not to\nlay at Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as\nshe could bring no proof of its injustice.",
    "She had never heard of him\nbefore his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged\nat the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally\nin town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.",
    "Of his former way\nof life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told him-\nself.",
    "As to his real character, had information been in her power, she\nhad never felt a wish of inquiring.",
    "His countenance, voice, and manner\nhad established him at once in the possession of every virtue.",
    "She tried\nto recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of in-\ntegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.\nDarcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual\nerrors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had\ndescribed as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance.",
    "But\nno such recollection befriended her.",
    "She could see him instantly be-\nfore her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember\nno more substantial good than the general approbation of the neigh-\nbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in\nthe mess.",
    "After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once\nmore continued to read.",
    "But, alas!",
    "the story which followed, of his\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some conﬁrmation from what had\npassed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning be-\nfore; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to\nColonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received\nthe information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and whose\ncharacter she had no reason to question.",
    "At one time she had almost\nresolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awk-\nwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the con-\nviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if\nhe had not been well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.",
    "She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conver-\nsation between Wickham and herself, in their ﬁrst evening at Mr.\nPhillips’s.",
    "Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.",
    "She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to\na stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.",
    "She saw the in-\ndelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the incon-\nsistency of his professions with his conduct.",
    "She remembered that he\nhad boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy\nmight leave the country, but that heshould stand his ground; yet he\nhad avoided the Netherﬁeld ball the very next week.",
    "She remembered\n144\nalso that, till the Netherﬁeld family had quitted the country, he had\ntold his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had\nbeen everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples\nin sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that re-\nspect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.",
    "How differently did everything now appear in which he was con-\ncerned!",
    "His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of\nviews solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her for-\ntune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness\nto grasp at anything.",
    "His behaviour to herself could now have had\nno tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her\nfortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the prefer-\nence which she believed she had most incautiously shown.",
    "Every lin-\ngering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther\njustiﬁcation of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when\nquestioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the af-\nfair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in\nthe whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had\nlatterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy\nwith his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or\nunjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that\namong his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even\nWickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often\nheard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable\nofsome amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham\nrepresented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly\nhave been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a\nperson capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was in-\ncomprehensible.",
    "She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.",
    "Of neither Darcy nor Wick-\nham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prej-\nudiced, absurd.",
    "“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided my-\nself on my discernment!",
    "I, who have valued myself on my abilities!",
    "who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and grat-\niﬁed my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!",
    "How humiliating is\nthis discovery!",
    "Yet, how just a humiliation!",
    "Had I been in love, I could\nnot have been more wretchedly blind!",
    "But vanity, not love, has been\nmy folly.",
    "Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the ne-\nglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have\ncourted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where\n145\neither were concerned.",
    "Till this moment I never knew myself.”\nFrom herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a\nline which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explana-\ntion there had appeared very insufﬁcient, and she read it again.",
    "Widely\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal.",
    "How could she deny that\ncredit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to\ngive in the other?",
    "He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her\nsister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Char-\nlotte’s opinion had always been.",
    "Neither could she deny the justice\nof his description of Jane.",
    "She felt that Jane’s feelings, though fervent,\nwere little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her\nair and manner not often united with great sensibility.",
    "When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense\nof shame was severe.",
    "The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\nfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as\nhaving passed at the Netherﬁeld ball, and as conﬁrming all his ﬁrst dis-\napprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\nthan on hers.",
    "The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.",
    "It soothed,\nbut it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-\nattracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane’s\ndisappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and\nreﬂected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such im-\npropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever\nknown before.",
    "After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\nvariety of thought—re-considering events, determining probabilities,\nand reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden\nand so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made\nher at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish\nof appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\nreﬂections as must make her unﬁt for conversation.",
    "She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had\neach called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to\ntake leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them\nat least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk\nafter her till she could be found.",
    "Elizabeth could but just affect concern\nin missing him; she really rejoiced at it.",
    "Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\nlonger an object; she could think only of her letter.",
    "146\nChapter 37\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins\nhaving been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obei-\nsance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appear-\ning in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected,\nafter the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.",
    "To Ros-\nings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter;\nand on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from\nher ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very\ndesirous of having them all to dine with her.",
    "Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\nhad she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as\nher future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her lady-\nship’s indignation would have been.",
    "“What would she have said?",
    "how\nwould she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused\nherself.",
    "Their ﬁrst subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.",
    "“I assure\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one feels\nthe loss of friends so much as I do.",
    "But I am particularly attached to\nthese young men, and know them to be so much attached to me!",
    "They\nwere excessively sorry to go!",
    "But so they always are.",
    "The dear Colonel\nrallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it\nmost acutely, more, I think, than last year.",
    "His attachment to Rosings\ncertainly increases.”\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\nwhich were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.",
    "Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\nout of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by suppos-\ning that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:\n“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that\nyou may stay a little longer.",
    "Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\ncompany, I am sure.”\n“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,”\nreplied Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it.",
    "I must be\nin town next Saturday.”\n“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.",
    "I ex-\npected you to stay two months.",
    "I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.",
    "There can be no occasion for your going so soon.",
    "Mrs. Bennet could\ncertainly spare you for another fortnight.”\n“But my father cannot.",
    "He wrote last week to hurry my return.”\n147\n“Oh!",
    "your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.",
    "Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.",
    "And if you\nwill stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one\nof you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week;\nand as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very\ngood room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen\nto be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of\nyou large.”\n“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\noriginal plan.”\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.",
    "“Mrs.",
    "Collins, you must send a\nservant with them.",
    "You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot\nbear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.",
    "It\nis highly improper.",
    "You must contrive to send somebody.",
    "I have the\ngreatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.",
    "Young women should\nalways be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation\nin life.",
    "When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I\nmade a point of her having two men-servants go with her.",
    "Miss Darcy,\nthe daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not\nhave appeared with propriety in a different manner.",
    "I am excessively\nattentive to all those things.",
    "You must send John with the young ladies,\nMrs. Collins.",
    "I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would\nreally be discreditable to youto let them go alone.”\n“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”\n“Oh!",
    "Your uncle!",
    "He keeps a man-servant, does he?",
    "I am very\nglad you have somebody who thinks of these things.",
    "Where shall you\nchange horses?",
    "Oh!",
    "Bromley, of course.",
    "If you mention my name at\nthe Bell, you will be attended to.”\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\njourney, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was nec-\nessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so\noccupied, she might have forgotten where she was.",
    "Reﬂection must be\nreserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\nas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in\nwhich she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.",
    "Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.",
    "She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\ntimes widely different.",
    "When she remembered the style of his address,\nshe was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compas-\n148\nsion.",
    "His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect;\nbut she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her\nrefusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.",
    "In her\nown past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and re-\ngret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier\nchagrin.",
    "They were hopeless of remedy.",
    "Her father, contented with\nlaughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild gid-\ndiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far\nfrom right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.",
    "Elizabeth had fre-\nquently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of\nCatherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s\nindulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?",
    "Catherine,\nweak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had\nbeen always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and care-\nless, would scarcely give them a hearing.",
    "They were ignorant, idle, and\nvain.",
    "While there was an ofﬁcer in Meryton, they would ﬂirt with him;\nand while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be\ngoing there forever.",
    "Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.\nDarcy’s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opin-\nion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.",
    "His affection was\nproved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, un-\nless any could attach to the implicitness of his conﬁdence in his friend.",
    "How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in\nevery respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness,\nJane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!",
    "When to these recollections was added the development of Wick-\nham’s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which\nhad seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to\nmake it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.",
    "Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\nweek of her stay as they had been at ﬁrst.",
    "The very last evening was\nspent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the partic-\nulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of\npacking, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the\nonly right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to\nundo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.",
    "When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\nwished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford\nagain next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curt-\nsey and hold out her hand to both.",
    "149\nChapter 38\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a\nfew minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity\nof paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably neces-\nsary.",
    "“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has\nyet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am\nvery certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks\nfor it.",
    "The favor of your company has been much felt, I assure you.",
    "We\nknow how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.",
    "Our\nplain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the\nlittle we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a\nyoung lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for\nthe condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to\nprevent your spending your time unpleasantly.”\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.",
    "She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of\nbeing with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must\nmake herfeel the obliged.",
    "Mr. Collins was gratiﬁed, and with a more\nsmiling solemnity replied:\n“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time\nnot disagreeably.",
    "We have certainly done our best; and most fortu-\nnately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society,\nand, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of vary-\ning the humble home scene, I think we may ﬂatter ourselves that your\nHunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.",
    "Our situation with\nregard to Lady Catherine’s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary\nadvantage and blessing which few can boast.",
    "You see on what a foot-\ning we are.",
    "You see how continually we are engaged there.",
    "In truth I\nmust acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble par-\nsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,\nwhile they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”\nWords were insufﬁcient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\nand truth in a few short sentences.",
    "“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hert-\nfordshire, my dear cousin.",
    "I ﬂatter myself at least that you will be able\nto do so.",
    "Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have\nbeen a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that\nyour friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as\n150\nwell to be silent.",
    "Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that\nI can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.",
    "My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.",
    "There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and\nideas between us.",
    "We seem to have been designed for each other.”\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that\nwas the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she ﬁrmly be-\nlieved and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.",
    "She was not sorry, how-\never, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom\nthey sprang.",
    "Poor Charlotte!",
    "it was melancholy to leave her to such so-\nciety!",
    "But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently\nregretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for com-\npassion.",
    "Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,\nand all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.",
    "At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\nparcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.",
    "After an\naffectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the\ncarriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was\ncommissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forget-\nting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the\nwinter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though un-\nknown.",
    "He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was\non the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any mes-\nsage for the ladies at Rosings.",
    "“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble\nrespects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness\nto you while you have been here.”\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut,\nand the carriage drove off.",
    "“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it\nseems but a day or two since we ﬁrst came!",
    "and yet how many things\nhave happened!”\n“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.",
    "“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\ntwice!",
    "How much I shall have to tell!”\nElizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any\nalarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached\nMr. Gardiner’s house, where they were to remain a few days.",
    "Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying\n151\nher spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her\naunt had reserved for them.",
    "But Jane was to go home with her, and at\nLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.",
    "It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even\nfor Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals.",
    "To\nknow that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly\nastonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever\nof her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a\ntemptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state\nof indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should\ncommunicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being\nhurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve\nher sister further.",
    "Chapter 39\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set\nout together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in Hertford-\nshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s car-\nriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coach-\nman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room\nupstairs.",
    "These two girls had been above an hour in the place, hap-\npily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel\non guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.",
    "After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table\nset out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\n“Is not this nice?",
    "Is not this an agreeable surprise?”\n“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend\nus the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then,\nshowing her purchases—“Look here, I have bought this bonnet.",
    "I do\nnot think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.",
    "I\nshall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up\nany better.”\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\nunconcern, “Oh!",
    "but there were two or three much uglier in the shop;\nand when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with\nfresh, I think it will be very tolerable.",
    "Besides, it will not much signify\nwhat one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton,\nand they are going in a fortnight.”\n“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.",
    "152\n“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want\npapa to take us all there for the summer!",
    "It would be such a delicious\nscheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all.",
    "Mamma\nwould like to go too of all things!",
    "Only think what a miserable summer\nelse we shall have!”\n“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “ thatwould be a delightful scheme in-\ndeed, and completely do for us at once.",
    "Good Heaven!",
    "Brighton, and\na whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by\none poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”\n“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down\nat table.",
    "“What do you think?",
    "It is excellent news—capital news—and\nabout a certain person we all like!”\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he\nneed not stay.",
    "Lydia laughed, and said:\n“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.",
    "You thought\nthe waiter must not hear, as if he cared!",
    "I dare say he often hears worse\nthings said than I am going to say.",
    "But he is an ugly fellow!",
    "I am glad\nhe is gone.",
    "I never saw such a long chin in my life.",
    "Well, but now for\nmy news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?",
    "There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King.",
    "There’s for you!",
    "She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.",
    "Wickham is\nsafe.”\n“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection\nimprudent as to fortune.”\n“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\n“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.",
    "“I am sure there is not on his.",
    "I will answer for it, he never cared\nthree straws about her—who could about such a nasty little freckled\nthing?”\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\ncoarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was lit-\ntle other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!",
    "As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\nboxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s\nand Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.",
    "“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia.",
    "“I am glad I\nbought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!",
    "Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all\nthe way home.",
    "And in the ﬁrst place, let us hear what has happened to\nyou all since you went away.",
    "Have you seen any pleasant men?",
    "Have\n153\nyou had any ﬂirting?",
    "I was in great hopes that one of you would have\ngot a husband before you came back.",
    "Jane will be quite an old maid\nsoon, I declare.",
    "She is almost three-and-twenty!",
    "Lord, how ashamed\nI should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!",
    "My aunt\nPhillips wants you so to get husbands, you can’t think.",
    "She says Lizzy\nhad better have taken Mr. Collins; but Ido not think there would have\nbeen any fun in it.",
    "Lord!",
    "how I should like to be married before any\nof you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.",
    "Dear me!",
    "we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s.",
    "Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised\nto have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me\naresuch friends!)",
    "and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but\nHarriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then,\nwhat do you think we did?",
    "We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s\nclothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!",
    "Not a soul\nknew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my\naunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot\nimagine how well he looked!",
    "When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt,\nand two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in\nthe least.",
    "Lord!",
    "how I laughed!",
    "and so did Mrs. Forster.",
    "I thought\nI should have died.",
    "And thatmade the men suspect something, and\nthen they soon found out what was the matter.”\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\nLydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\ncompanions all the way to Longbourn.",
    "Elizabeth listened as little as she\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s\nname.",
    "Their reception at home was most kind.",
    "Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see\nJane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did\nMr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\n“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects\nthat occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the wel-\nfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly en-\ngaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from\nJane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all\nto the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any\nother person’s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning\nto anybody who would hear her.",
    "“Oh!",
    "Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had\n154\nsuch fun!",
    "As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pre-\ntended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all\nthe way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do\nthink we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with\nthe nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we\nwould have treated you too.",
    "And then when we came away it was\nsuch fun!",
    "I thought we never should have got into the coach.",
    "I was\nready to die of laughter.",
    "And then we were so merry all the way home!",
    "we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten\nmiles off!”\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sis-\nter, to depreciate such pleasures!",
    "They would doubtless be congenial\nwith the generality of female minds.",
    "But I confess they would have no\ncharms for me—I should inﬁnitely prefer a book.”\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word.",
    "She seldom listened to\nanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at\nall.",
    "In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk\nto Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily\nopposed the scheme.",
    "It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could\nnot be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the ofﬁcers.",
    "There was another reason too for her opposition.",
    "She dreaded seeing\nMr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.",
    "The comfort to herof the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed\nbeyond expression.",
    "In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, she\nhoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.",
    "She had not been many hours at home before she found that the\nBrighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was\nunder frequent discussion between her parents.",
    "Elizabeth saw directly\nthat her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his an-\nswers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother,\nthough often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at\nlast.",
    "Chapter 40\nElizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\ncould no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress\nevery particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her\nto be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the\n155\nscene between Mr. Darcy and herself.",
    "Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sis-\nterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear per-\nfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.",
    "She\nwas sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a\nmanner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she\ngrieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given\nhim.",
    "“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and cer-\ntainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must\nincrease his disappointment!”\n“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\nother feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.",
    "You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”\n“Blame you!",
    "Oh, no.”\n“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”\n“No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”\n“But you willknow it, when I tell you what happened the very next\nday.”\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\nas they concerned George Wickham.",
    "What a stroke was this for poor\nJane!",
    "who would willingly have gone through the world without be-\nlieving that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind,\nas was here collected in one individual.",
    "Nor was Darcy’s vindication,\nthough grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such dis-\ncovery.",
    "Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error,\nand seek to clear the one without involving the other.",
    "“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make\nboth of them good for anything.",
    "Take your choice, but you must be\nsatisﬁed with only one.",
    "There is but such a quantity of merit between\nthem; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been\nshifting about pretty much.",
    "For my part, I am inclined to believe it all\nDarcy’s; but you shall do as you choose.”\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from\nJane.",
    "“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she.",
    "“Wick-\nham so very bad!",
    "It is almost past belief.",
    "And poor Mr. Darcy!",
    "Dear\nLizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.",
    "Such a disappoint-\nment!",
    "and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!",
    "and having to\nrelate such a thing of his sister!",
    "It is really too distressing.",
    "I am sure\nyou must feel it so.”\n156\n“Oh!",
    "no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing\nyou so full of both.",
    "I know you will do him such ample justice, that\nI am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.",
    "Your\nprofusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer,\nmy heart will be as light as a feather.”\n“Poor Wickham!",
    "there is such an expression of goodness in his\ncountenance!",
    "such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”\n“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education\nof those two young men.",
    "One has got all the goodness, and the other\nall the appearance of it.”\n“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deﬁcient in the appearance of it as you\nused to do.”\n“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided\na dislike to him, without any reason.",
    "It is such a spur to one’s genius,\nsuch an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.",
    "One may be con-\ntinually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always\nbe laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something\nwitty.”\n“Lizzy, when you ﬁrst read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\nthe matter as you do now.”\n“Indeed, I could not.",
    "I was uncomfortable enough, I may say un-\nhappy.",
    "And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to com-\nfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsen-\nsical as I knew I had!",
    "Oh!",
    "how I wanted you!”\n“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong ex-\npressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they doappear\nwholly undeserved.”\n“Certainly.",
    "But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.",
    "There\nis one point on which I want your advice.",
    "I want to be told whether I\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand\nWickham’s character.”\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be\nno occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.",
    "What is your opinion?”\n“That it ought not to be attempted.",
    "Mr. Darcy has not authorised\nme to make his communication public.",
    "On the contrary, every partic-\nular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his con-\nduct, who will believe me?",
    "The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is\nso violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Mery-\nton to attempt to place him in an amiable light.",
    "I am not equal to it.",
    "157\nWickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to any-\none here what he really is.",
    "Some time hence it will be all found out,\nand then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.",
    "At\npresent I will say nothing about it.”\n“You are quite right.",
    "To have his errors made public might ruin him\nfor ever.",
    "He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious\nto re-establish a character.",
    "We must not make him desperate.”\nThe tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation.",
    "She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a\nfortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she\nmight wish to talk again of either.",
    "But there was still something lurk-\ning behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure.",
    "She dared not\nrelate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister how\nsincerely she had been valued by her friend.",
    "Here was knowledge in\nwhich no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less\nthan a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery.",
    "“And then,” said she,\n“if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely\nbe able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner\nhimself.",
    "The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all\nits value!”\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\nreal state of her sister’s spirits.",
    "Jane was not happy.",
    "She still cherished\na very tender affection for Bingley.",
    "Having never even fancied herself\nin love before, her regard had all the warmth of ﬁrst attachment, and,\nfrom her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most ﬁrst attach-\nments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\nand prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her\nattention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the in-\ndulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own\nhealth and their tranquillity.",
    "“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion now\nof this sad business of Jane’s?",
    "For my part, I am determined never to\nspeak of it again to anybody.",
    "I told my sister Phillips so the other day.",
    "But I cannot ﬁnd out that Jane saw anything of him in London.",
    "Well,\nhe is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there’s the\nleast chance in the world of her ever getting him now.",
    "There is no talk\nof his coming to Netherﬁeld again in the summer; and I have inquired\nof everybody, too, who is likely to know.”\n“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherﬁeld any more.”\n“Oh well!",
    "it is just as he chooses.",
    "Nobody wants him to come.",
    "158\nThough I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if\nI was her, I would not have put up with it.",
    "Well, my comfort is, I am\nsure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what\nhe has done.”\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expecta-\ntion, she made no answer.",
    "“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the\nCollinses live very comfortable, do they?",
    "Well, well, I only hope it will\nlast.",
    "And what sort of table do they keep?",
    "Charlotte is an excellent\nmanager, I dare say.",
    "If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving\nenough.",
    "There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare\nsay.”\n“No, nothing at all.”\n“A great deal of good management, depend upon it.",
    "Yes, yes.",
    "they\nwill take care not to outrun their income.",
    "They will never be distressed\nfor money.",
    "Well, much good may it do them!",
    "And so, I suppose, they\noften talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.",
    "They look\nupon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”\n“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”\n“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt\nthey often talk of it between themselves.",
    "Well, if they can be easy with\nan estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.",
    "I should be\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”\nChapter 41\nThe ﬁrst week of their return was soon gone.",
    "The second began.",
    "It\nwas the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies\nin the neighbourhood were drooping apace.",
    "The dejection was almost\nuniversal.",
    "The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\nand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.",
    "Very\nfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Ly-\ndia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend\nsuch hard-heartedness in any of the family.",
    "“Good Heaven!",
    "what is to become of us?",
    "What are we to do?”\nwould they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.",
    "“How can you be\nsmiling so, Lizzy?”\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\nwhat she had herself endured on a similar occasion, ﬁve-and-twenty\nyears ago.",
    "159\n“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel\nMiller’s regiment went away.",
    "I thought I should have broken my\nheart.”\n“I am sure I shall break mine,” said Lydia.",
    "“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.",
    "“Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton!",
    "But papa is so disagree-\nable.”\n“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”\n“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do mea great deal of good,”\nadded Kitty.",
    "Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\nthrough Longbourn House.",
    "Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them;\nbut all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.",
    "She felt anew the justice of\nMr. Darcy’s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to\npardon his interference in the views of his friend.",
    "But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\nshe received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of\nthe regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.",
    "This invaluable friend\nwas a very young woman, and very lately married.",
    "A resemblance\nin good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to\neach other, and out of their three months’ acquaintance they had been\nintimate two.",
    "The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\nthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortiﬁcation of Kitty, are scarcely\nto be described.",
    "Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia ﬂew\nabout the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratula-\ntions, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst\nthe luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms\nas unreasonable as her accent was peevish.",
    "“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask meas well as Lydia,”\nsaid she, “Though I am nother particular friend.",
    "I have just as much\nright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to\nmake her resigned.",
    "As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far\nfrom exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that\nshe considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common\nsense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were\nit known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\ngo.",
    "She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general be-\nhaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet\n160\nmore imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temp-\ntations must be greater than at home.",
    "He heard her attentively, and\nthen said:\n“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\npublic place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little\nexpense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circum-\nstances.”\n“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvan-\ntage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s un-\nguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already arisen from\nit, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.”\n“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet.",
    "“What, has she frightened\naway some of your lovers?",
    "Poor little Lizzy!",
    "But do not be cast down.",
    "Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little\nabsurdity are not worth a regret.",
    "Come, let me see the list of pitiful\nfellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”\n“Indeed you are mistaken.",
    "I have no such injuries to resent.",
    "It is not\nof particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.",
    "Our\nimportance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the\nwild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\nLydia’s character.",
    "Excuse me, for I must speak plainly.",
    "If you, my dear\nfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\nof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\nher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.",
    "Her charac-\nter will be ﬁxed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined ﬂirt\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a ﬂirt, too, in the worst\nand meanest degree of ﬂirtation; without any attraction beyond youth\nand a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her\nmind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal con-\ntempt which her rage for admiration will excite.",
    "In this danger Kitty\nalso is comprehended.",
    "She will follow wherever Lydia leads.",
    "Vain, ig-\nnorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!",
    "Oh!",
    "my dear father, can you\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wher-\never they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in\nthe disgrace?”\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affec-\ntionately taking her hand said in reply:\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.",
    "Wherever you and Jane are\nknown you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to\nless advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly\nsisters.",
    "We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\n161\nBrighton.",
    "Let her go, then.",
    "Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\nkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\nobject of prey to anybody.",
    "At Brighton she will be of less importance\neven as a common ﬂirt than she has been here.",
    "The ofﬁcers will ﬁnd\nwomen better worth their notice.",
    "Let us hope, therefore, that her being\nthere may teach her her own insigniﬁcance.",
    "At any rate, she cannot\ngrow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for\nthe rest of her life.”\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own\nopinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.",
    "It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling\non them.",
    "She was conﬁdent of having performed her duty, and to fret\nover unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\ndisposition.",
    "Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference\nwith her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression\nin their united volubility.",
    "In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton\ncomprised every possibility of earthly happiness.",
    "She saw, with the\ncreative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with\nofﬁcers.",
    "She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores\nof them at present unknown.",
    "She saw all the glories of the camp—its\ntents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with\nthe young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the\nview, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly ﬂirting with at\nleast six ofﬁcers at once.",
    "Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\nand such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?",
    "They\ncould have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt\nnearly the same.",
    "Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her\nfor her melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go\nthere himself.",
    "But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their rap-\ntures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s\nleaving home.",
    "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.",
    "Having\nbeen frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was\npretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so.",
    "She had\neven learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had ﬁrst delighted\nher, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.",
    "In his present\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\nfor the inclination he soon testiﬁed of renewing those intentions which\n162\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her.",
    "She lost all concern for him\nin ﬁnding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for what-\never cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be\ngratiﬁed, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.",
    "On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he\ndined, with other of the ofﬁcers, at Longbourn; and so little was Eliz-\nabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his mak-\ning some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at\nHunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s hav-\ning both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was ac-\nquainted with the former.",
    "He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\nasked her how she had liked him.",
    "Her answer was warmly in his\nfavour.",
    "With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:\n“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”\n“Nearly three weeks.”\n“And you saw him frequently?”\n“Yes, almost every day.”\n“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\n“Yes, very different.",
    "But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquain-\ntance.”\n“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.",
    "“And pray, may I ask?—” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer\ntone, “Is it in address that he improves?",
    "Has he deigned to add aught\nof civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope,” he continued in\na lower and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”\n“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth.",
    "“In essentials, I believe, he is very much\nwhat he ever was.”\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether\nto rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.",
    "There was a\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an appre-\nhensive and anxious attention, while she added:\n“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\nthat his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that,\nfrom knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”\nWickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\n163\nagitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his em-\nbarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:\n“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will read-\nily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to\nassume even the appearance of what is right.",
    "His pride, in that direc-\ntion, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must\nonly deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.",
    "I only\nfear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been\nalluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\nopinion and judgement he stands much in awe.",
    "His fear of her has al-\nways operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to\nbe imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh,\nwhich I am certain he has very much at heart.”\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only\nby a slight inclination of the head.",
    "She saw that he wanted to engage\nher on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to\nindulge him.",
    "The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his\nside, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\nmutual desire of never meeting again.",
    "When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\nMeryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.",
    "The\nseparation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.",
    "Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation\nand envy.",
    "Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity\nof her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not\nmiss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible—advice\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well attended to;\nand in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell,\nthe more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.",
    "Chapter 42\nHad Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\ncould not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or\ndomestic comfort.",
    "Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and\nthat appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally\ngive, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal\nmind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for\nher.",
    "Respect, esteem, and conﬁdence had vanished for ever; and all his\n164\nviews of domestic happiness were overthrown.",
    "But Mr. Bennet was not\nof a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\nimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly of their vice.",
    "He was fond of the\ncountry and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\nenjoyments.",
    "To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.",
    "This is not\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\nphilosopher will derive beneﬁt from such as are given.",
    "Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\nfather’s behaviour as a husband.",
    "She had always seen it with pain;\nbut respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment\nof herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and\nto banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obliga-\ntion and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her\nown children, was so highly reprehensible.",
    "But she had never felt so\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of\nso unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils aris-\ning from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.",
    "When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she found\nlittle other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.",
    "Their\nparties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a\nmother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of every-\nthing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and,\nthough Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since\nthe disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose\ndisposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hard-\nened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double dan-\nger as a watering-place and a camp.",
    "Upon the whole, therefore, she\nfound, what has been sometimes been found before, that an event to\nwhich she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking\nplace, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.",
    "It was conse-\nquently necessary to name some other period for the commencement\nof actual felicity—to have some other point on which her wishes and\nhopes might be ﬁxed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipa-\ntion, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disap-\npointment.",
    "Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest\nthoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours\n165\nwhich the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable;\nand could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would\nhave been perfect.",
    "“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish\nfor.",
    "Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would\nbe certain.",
    "But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret\nin my sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expec-\ntations of pleasure realised.",
    "A scheme of which every part promises\ndelight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only\nwarded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very\nminutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long ex-\npected, and always very short.",
    "Those to her mother contained little\nelse than that they were just returned from the library, where such and\nsuch ofﬁcers had attended them, and where she had seen such beau-\ntiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or\na new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was\nobliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and\nthey were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her\nsister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though\nrather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made\npublic.",
    "After the ﬁrst fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\nhumour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.",
    "Every-\nthing wore a happier aspect.",
    "The families who had been in town for\nthe winter came back again, and summer ﬁnery and summer engage-\nments arose.",
    "Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity;\nand, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able\nto enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as\nto make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be\nso tolerably reasonable as not to mention an ofﬁcer above once a day,\nunless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Ofﬁce,\nanother regiment should be quartered in Meryton.",
    "The time ﬁxed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\nfast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement\nand curtailed its extent.",
    "Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business\nfrom setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London\nagain within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go\nso far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\n166\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the\npresent plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire.",
    "In that\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.",
    "The\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object\nof her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\nDovedale, or the Peak.",
    "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\nseeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough.",
    "But it was her business to be satisﬁed—and certainly her temper to be\nhappy; and all was soon right again.",
    "With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.",
    "It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pember-\nley and its owner.",
    "“But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with-\nout impunity, and rob it of a few petriﬁed spars without his perceiving\nme.”\nThe period of expectation was now doubled.",
    "Four weeks were to\npass away before her uncle and aunt’s arrival.",
    "But they did pass away,\nand Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length ap-\npear at Longbourn.",
    "The children, two girls of six and eight years old,\nand two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their\ncousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense\nand sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in\nevery way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.",
    "The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off\nthe next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amuse-\nment.",
    "One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of compan-\nions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\ninconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affec-\ntion and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there\nwere disappointments abroad.",
    "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\nnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\nlay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc.",
    "are\nsufﬁciently known.",
    "A small part of Derbyshire is all the present con-\ncern.",
    "To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s for-\nmer residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance\nstill remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal\nwonders of the country; and within ﬁve miles of Lambton, Elizabeth\nfound from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.",
    "It was not in their\n167\ndirect road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.",
    "In talking over their\nroute the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see\nthe place again.",
    "Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth\nwas applied to for her approbation.",
    "“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\nheard so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many\nof your acquaintances are connected.",
    "Wickham passed all his youth\nthere, you know.”\nElizabeth was distressed.",
    "She felt that she had no business at Pem-\nberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.",
    "She\nmust own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so\nmany, she really had no pleasure in ﬁne carpets or satin curtains.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.",
    "“If it were merely a ﬁne house\nrichly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\ngrounds are delightful.",
    "They have some of the ﬁnest woods in the\ncountry.”\nElizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce.",
    "The\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly oc-\ncurred.",
    "It would be dreadful!",
    "She blushed at the very idea, and thought\nit would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.",
    "But against this there were objections; and she ﬁnally resolved that it\ncould be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the\nfamily were unfavourably answered.",
    "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\nwhether Pemberley were not a very ﬁne place?",
    "what was the name\nof its proprietor?",
    "and, with no little alarm, whether the family were\ndown for the summer?",
    "A most welcome negative followed the last\nquestion—and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to\nfeel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the\nsubject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to,\ncould readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she\nhad not really any dislike to the scheme.",
    "To Pemberley, therefore, they\nwere to go.",
    "Chapter 43\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the ﬁrst appearance of\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they\nturned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high ﬂutter.",
    "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.",
    "168\nThey entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time\nthrough a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.",
    "Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\nadmired every remarkable spot and point of view.",
    "They gradually\nascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a\nconsiderable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was in-\nstantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of\na valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.",
    "It was a\nlarge, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and\nbacked by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some\nnatural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artiﬁcial\nappearance.",
    "Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.",
    "Eliza-\nbeth was delighted.",
    "She had never seen a place for which nature had\ndone more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by\nan awkward taste.",
    "They were all of them warm in their admiration;\nand at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be\nsomething!",
    "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door;\nand, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehen-\nsion of meeting its owner returned.",
    "She dreaded lest the chambermaid\nhad been mistaken.",
    "On applying to see the place, they were admitted\ninto the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had\nleisure to wonder at her being where she was.",
    "The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman,\nmuch less ﬁne, and more civil, than she had any notion of ﬁnding her.",
    "They followed her into the dining-parlour.",
    "It was a large, well pro-\nportioned room, handsomely ﬁtted up.",
    "Elizabeth, after slightly sur-\nveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.",
    "The hill, crowned\nwith wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abrupt-\nness from the distance, was a beautiful object.",
    "Every disposition of\nthe ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river,\nthe trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far\nas she could trace it, with delight.",
    "As they passed into other rooms\nthese objects were taking different positions; but from every window\nthere were beauties to be seen.",
    "The rooms were lofty and handsome,\nand their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Eliza-\nbeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor\nuselessly ﬁne; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\nfurniture of Rosings.",
    "“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress!",
    "With\nthese rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!",
    "Instead\n169\nof viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my\nown, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.",
    "But no,”—\nrecollecting herself—“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would\nhave been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\nThis was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very\nlike regret.",
    "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was\nreally absent, but had not the courage for it.",
    "At length however, the\nquestion was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm,\nwhile Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him\nto-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth\nthat their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a\nday!",
    "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.",
    "She approached and\nsaw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\nminiatures, over the mantelpiece.",
    "Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\nshe liked it.",
    "The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a\npicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward,\nwho had been brought up by him at his own expense.",
    "“He is now\ngone into the army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out\nvery wild.”\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could\nnot return it.",
    "“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the minia-\ntures, “is my master—and very like him.",
    "It was drawn at the same time\nas the other—about eight years ago.”\n“I have heard much of your master’s ﬁne person,” said Mrs. Gar-\ndiner, looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face.",
    "But, Lizzy, you can\ntell us whether it is like or not.”\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this inti-\nmation of her knowing her master.",
    "“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\nElizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”\n“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\n“Yes, very handsome.”\n“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs\nyou will see a ﬁner, larger picture of him than this.",
    "This room was my\nlate master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used\nto be then.",
    "He was very fond of them.”\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.",
    "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,\n170\ndrawn when she was only eight years old.",
    "“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gar-\ndiner.",
    "“Oh!",
    "yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\naccomplished!—She plays and sings all day long.",
    "In the next room is\na new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master;\nshe comes here to-morrow with him.”\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, en-\ncouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.\nReynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure\nin talking of her master and his sister.",
    "“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\n“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half\nhis time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\n“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\n“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\n“Yes, sir; but I do not know when thatwill be.",
    "I do not know who\nis good enough for him.”\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.",
    "Elizabeth could not help saying, “It\nis very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\n“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows\nhim,” replied the other.",
    "Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper\nadded, “I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and\nI have known him ever since he was four years old.”\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\nto her ideas.",
    "That he was not a good-tempered man had been her\nﬁrmest opinion.",
    "Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to\nhear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\n“There are very few people of whom so much can be said.",
    "You are\nlucky in having such a master.”\n“Yes, sir, I know I am.",
    "If I were to go through the world, I could\nnot meet with a better.",
    "But I have always observed, that they who are\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up;\nand he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy\nin the world.”\nElizabeth almost stared at her.",
    "“Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought\nshe.",
    "“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.",
    "“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—\njust as affable to the poor.”\n171\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\nmore.",
    "Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point.",
    "She related\nthe subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price\nof the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of\nfamily prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation\nof her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy\non his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.",
    "“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\nlived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing\nbut themselves.",
    "There is not one of his tenants or servants but will\ngive him a good name.",
    "Some people call him proud; but I am sure I\nnever saw anything of it.",
    "To my fancy, it is only because he does not\nrattle away like other young men.”\n“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.",
    "“This ﬁne account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is\nnot quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\n“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\n“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very\npretty sitting-room, lately ﬁtted up with greater elegance and light-\nness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but\njust done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the\nroom when last at Pemberley.",
    "“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked to-\nwards one of the windows.",
    "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should\nenter the room.",
    "“And this is always the way with him,” she added.",
    "“Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a mo-\nment.",
    "There is nothing he would not do for her.”\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\nwere all that remained to be shown.",
    "In the former were many good\npaintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as\nhad been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at\nsome drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usu-\nally more interesting, and also more intelligible.",
    "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\nlittle to ﬁx the attention of a stranger.",
    "Elizabeth walked in quest of\nthe only face whose features would be known to her.",
    "At last it ar-\nrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with\nsuch a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen\nwhen he looked at her.",
    "She stood several minutes before the picture,\n172\nin earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted\nthe gallery.",
    "Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his\nfather’s lifetime.",
    "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more\ngentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the\nheight of their acquaintance.",
    "The commendation bestowed on him by\nMrs. Reynolds was of no triﬂing nature.",
    "What praise is more valu-\nable than the praise of an intelligent servant?",
    "As a brother, a landlord,\na master, she considered how many people’s happiness were in his\nguardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to\nbestow!—how much of good or evil must be done by him!",
    "Every idea\nthat had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to\nhis character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was rep-\nresented, and ﬁxed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard\nwith a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she\nremembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.",
    "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been\nseen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper,\nwere consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.",
    "As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned\nback to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the\nformer was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it\nhimself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to\nthe stables.",
    "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\nhis appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.",
    "Their eyes\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\nblush.",
    "He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable\nfrom surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the\nparty, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at\nleast of perfect civility.",
    "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\novercome.",
    "Had his ﬁrst appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\nthey had just been examining, been insufﬁcient to assure the other two\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise,\non beholding his master, must immediately have told it.",
    "They stood\na little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and\nconfused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what\nanswer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.",
    "Amazed at\nthe alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\n173\nhe uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\nminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfort-\nable in her life.",
    "Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his\naccent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries\nas to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\ndistraction of his thoughts.",
    "At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and\ntook leave.",
    "The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his ﬁgure;\nbut Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feel-\nings, followed them in silence.",
    "She was overpowered by shame and\nvexation.",
    "Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-\njudged thing in the world!",
    "How strange it must appear to him!",
    "In\nwhat a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!",
    "It might\nseem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!",
    "Oh!",
    "why did she come?",
    "Or, why did he thus come a day before he was\nexpected?",
    "Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have\nbeen beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he\nwas that moment arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or\nhis carriage.",
    "She blushed again and again over the perverseness of\nthe meeting.",
    "And his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it\nmean?",
    "That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak\nwith such civility, to inquire after her family!",
    "Never in her life had she\nseen his manners so little digniﬁed, never had he spoken with such\ngentleness as on this unexpected meeting.",
    "What a contrast did it of-\nfer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her\nhand!",
    "She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.",
    "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\nand every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a ﬁner\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some\ntime before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she an-\nswered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt,\nand seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\ndistinguished no part of the scene.",
    "Her thoughts were all ﬁxed on that\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy\nthen was.",
    "She longed to know what at the moment was passing in\nhis mind—in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in deﬁance\nof everything, she was still dear to him.",
    "Perhaps he had been civil\n174\nonly because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been thatin his voice\nwhich was not like ease.",
    "Whether he had felt more of pain or of plea-\nsure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her\nwith composure.",
    "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence\nof mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like\nherself.",
    "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\nascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the open-\ning of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming\nviews of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\noverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.",
    "Mr. Gar-\ndiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it\nmight be beyond a walk.",
    "With a triumphant smile they were told that\nit was ten miles round.",
    "It settled the matter; and they pursued the\naccustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a\ndescent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of\nits narrowest parts.",
    "They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character\nwith the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any\nthey had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed\nroom only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-\nwood which bordered it.",
    "Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but\nwhen they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from\nthe house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no\nfarther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as pos-\nsible.",
    "Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their\nway towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest\ndirection; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom\nable to indulge the taste, was very fond of ﬁshing, and was so much\nengaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the\nwater, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.",
    "Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised,\nand Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at\nﬁrst, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great dis-\ntance.",
    "The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side,\nallowed them to see him before they met.",
    "Elizabeth, however aston-\nished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and\nresolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to\nmeet them.",
    "For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would prob-\nably strike into some other path.",
    "The idea lasted while a turning in\nthe walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was im-\n175\nmediately before them.",
    "With a glance, she saw that he had lost none\nof his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they\nmet, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the\nwords “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky recollections\nobtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be\nmischievously construed.",
    "Her colour changed, and she said no more.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he\nasked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her\nfriends.",
    "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unpre-\npared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking\nthe acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride\nhad revolted in his offer to herself.",
    "“What will be his surprise,” thought\nshe, “when he knows who they are?",
    "He takes them now for people of\nfashion.”\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she\nnamed their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see\nhow he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamp-\ning as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.",
    "That he was\nsurprised by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with\nfortitude, and so far from going away, turned his back with them, and\nentered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.",
    "Elizabeth could not but\nbe pleased, could not but triumph.",
    "It was consoling that he should\nknow she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.",
    "She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and glo-\nried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked\nhis intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.",
    "The conversation soon turned upon ﬁshing; and she heard Mr.\nDarcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to ﬁsh there as often as he\nchose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\ntime to supply him with ﬁshing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\nthe stream where there was usually most sport.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner, who\nwas walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of\nwonder.",
    "Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratiﬁed her exceedingly; the\ncompliment must be all for herself.",
    "Her astonishment, however, was\nextreme, and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered?",
    "From what can it proceed?",
    "It cannot be for me—it cannot be for mysake\nthat his manners are thus softened.",
    "My reproofs at Hunsford could not\nwork such a change as this.",
    "It is impossible that he should still love\nme.”\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\n176\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant,\nthere chanced to be a little alteration.",
    "It originated in Mrs. Gardiner,\nwho, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth’s arm\ninadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband’s.",
    "Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.",
    "After a short silence, the lady ﬁrst spoke.",
    "She wished him to know\nthat she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place,\nand accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\nunexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected\nin the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few\nhours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.",
    "“They will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them\nare some who will claim an acquaintance with you—Mr.",
    "Bingley and\nhis sisters.”\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow.",
    "Her thoughts were in-\nstantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been the\nlast mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complex-\nion,hismind was not very differently engaged.",
    "“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\npause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you.",
    "Will you\nallow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquain-\ntance during your stay at Lambton?”\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\ngreat for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.",
    "She imme-\ndiately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being ac-\nquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without look-\ning farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his re-\nsentment had not made him think really ill of her.",
    "They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.",
    "Eliz-\nabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was ﬂattered\nand pleased.",
    "His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compli-\nment of the highest kind.",
    "They soon outstripped the others, and when\nthey had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quar-\nter of a mile behind.",
    "He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself\nnot tired, and they stood together on the lawn.",
    "At such a time much\nmight have been said, and silence was very awkward.",
    "She wanted to\ntalk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject.",
    "At last she\n177\nrecollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock\nand Dove Dale with great perseverance.",
    "Yet time and her aunt moved\nslowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before\nthe tete-a-tete was over.",
    "On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they\nwere all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but\nthis was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness.",
    "Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,\nElizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.",
    "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\nthem pronounced him to be inﬁnitely superior to anything they had\nexpected.",
    "“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said\nher uncle.",
    "“There issomething a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\naunt, “but it is conﬁned to his air, and is not unbecoming.",
    "I can now say\nwith the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I\nhave seen nothing of it.”\n“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.",
    "It was\nmore than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for\nsuch attention.",
    "His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very triﬂing.”\n“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wick-\nham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\nperfectly good.",
    "But how came you to tell me that he was so disagree-\nable?”\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\nliked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she\nhad never seen him so pleasant as this morning.",
    "“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\nher uncle.",
    "“Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\nat his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me\noff his grounds.”\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character,\nbut said nothing.",
    "“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I re-\nally should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel\na way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.",
    "He has not an\nill-natured look.",
    "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his\nmouth when he speaks.",
    "And there is something of dignity in his coun-\ntenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.",
    "But,\nto be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most\nﬂaming character!",
    "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.",
    "But\nhe is a liberal master, I suppose, and thatin the eye of a servant com-\n178\nprehends every virtue.”\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindica-\ntion of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to under-\nstand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard\nfrom his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\nWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.",
    "In conﬁrmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually nam-\ning her authority, but stating it to be such as such as might be relied\non.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing\nout to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\nanything else.",
    "Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk they\nhad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former ac-\nquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a inter-\ncourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.",
    "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Eliz-\nabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do\nnothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and,\nabove all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.",
    "Chapter 44\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.",
    "But\nher conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at\nLambton, these visitors came.",
    "They had been walking about the place\nwith some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to\ndress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady\nin a curricle driving up the street.",
    "Elizabeth immediately recognizing\nthe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\nsurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which\nshe expected.",
    "Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the em-\nbarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance\nitself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to\n179\nthem a new idea on the business.",
    "Nothing had ever suggested it be-\nfore, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such\nattentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their\nniece.",
    "While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the\nperturbation of Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing.",
    "She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other\ncauses of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should\nhave said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious\nto please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would\nfail her.",
    "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\nwalked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw\nsuch looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every-\nthing worse.",
    "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable intro-\nduction took place.",
    "With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.",
    "Since her be-\ning at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\nonly exceedingly shy.",
    "She found it difﬁcult to obtain even a word from\nher beyond a monosyllable.",
    "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\nthough little more than sixteen, her ﬁgure was formed, and her appear-\nance womanly and graceful.",
    "She was less handsome than her brother;\nbut there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners\nwere perfectly unassuming and gentle.",
    "Elizabeth, who had expected to\nﬁnd in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy\nhad been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.",
    "They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bin-\ngley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to ex-\npress her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s\nquick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the\nroom.",
    "All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but\nhad she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the\nunaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her\nagain.",
    "He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,\nand looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had\never done.",
    "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting person-\nage than to herself.",
    "They had long wished to see him.",
    "The whole party\nbefore them, indeed, excited a lively attention.",
    "The suspicions which\n180\nhad just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation\ntowards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon\ndrew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least\nknew what it was to love.",
    "Of the lady’s sensations they remained a lit-\ntle in doubt; but that the gentleman was overﬂowing with admiration\nwas evident enough.",
    "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.",
    "She wanted to ascertain the\nfeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared\nmost to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she en-\ndeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.",
    "Bingley\nwas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.",
    "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally ﬂew to her sister; and, oh!",
    "how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed\nin a like manner.",
    "Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than\non former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.",
    "But,\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his be-\nhaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane.",
    "No look\nappeared on either side that spoke particular regard.",
    "Nothing occurred\nbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister.",
    "On this point\nshe was soon satisﬁed; and two or three little circumstances occurred\nere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a rec-\nollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\nmore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.",
    "He observed\nto her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a\ntone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time\nsince he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could re-\nply, he added, “It is above eight months.",
    "We have not met since the\n26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherﬁeld.”\nElizabeth was pleased to ﬁnd his memory so exact; and he after-\nwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,\nwhether allher sisters were at Longbourn.",
    "There was not much in the\nquestion, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a man-\nner which gave them meaning.",
    "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy him-\nself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression\nof general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent\nso removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced\nher that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday wit-\nnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least out-\n181\nlived one day.",
    "When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and\ncourting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few\nmonths ago would have been a disgrace—when she saw him thus civil,\nnot only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly dis-\ndained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—\nthe difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her\nmind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being vis-\nible.",
    "Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherﬁeld,\nor his digniﬁed relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to\nplease, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now,\nwhen no importance could result from the success of his endeavours,\nand when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were\naddressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies\nboth of Netherﬁeld and Rosings.",
    "Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they\narose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in express-\ning their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to\ndinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.",
    "Miss Darcy, though\nwith a difﬁdence which marked her little in the habit of giving invita-\ntions, readily obeyed.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of\nknowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed\nas to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.",
    "Presum-\ning however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary\nembarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her hus-\nband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she\nventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was\nﬁxed on.",
    "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Eliza-\nbeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries\nto make after all their Hertfordshire friends.",
    "Elizabeth, construing all\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\nthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors\nleft them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfac-\ntion, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.",
    "Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and\naunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable\nopinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",
    "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it\nwas not their wish to force her communication.",
    "It was evident that she\nwas much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any\nidea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.",
    "They\n182\nsaw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.",
    "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as\nfar as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to ﬁnd.",
    "They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy.",
    "There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to\nbe hastily rejected.",
    "Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.",
    "They had\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it\nwould certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\nwhere the family did not visit.",
    "It was acknowledged, however, that he\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.",
    "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not\nheld there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with\nthe son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-\nknown fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts\nbehind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",
    "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more\nthan the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was\nnot long enough to determine her feelings towards onein that man-\nsion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them\nout.",
    "She certainly did not hate him.",
    "No; hatred had vanished long\nago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dis-\nlike against him, that could be so called.",
    "The respect created by the\nconviction of his valuable qualities, though at ﬁrst unwillingly admit-\nted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it\nwas now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testi-\nmony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in\nso amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.",
    "But above all, above\nrespect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which\ncould not be overlooked.",
    "It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for\nhaving once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive\nall the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all\nthe unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.",
    "He who, she had\nbeen persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on\nthis accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and\nwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\n183\nwhere their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\nopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.",
    "Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonish-\nment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and\nas such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by\nno means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly deﬁned.",
    "She re-\nspected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest\nin his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that\nwelfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the hap-\npiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told\nher she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.",
    "It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece,\nthat such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to see them on\nthe very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to\na late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\nby some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning.",
    "They were, therefore, to go.",
    "Elizabeth was pleased; though\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.",
    "Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.",
    "The ﬁshing scheme had\nbeen renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his\nmeeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.",
    "Chapter 45\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her\nhad originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome\nher appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know\nwith how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would\nnow be renewed.",
    "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the\nsaloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.",
    "Its\nwindows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of\nthe high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and\nSpanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.",
    "In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting\nthere with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she\nlived in London.",
    "Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but\nattended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from\nshyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who\n184\nfelt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved.",
    "Mrs.\nGardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.",
    "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curt-\nsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must\nalways be, succeeded for a few moments.",
    "It was ﬁrst broken by Mrs.\nAnnesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to\nintroduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-\nbred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner,\nwith occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.",
    "Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and\nsometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger\nof its being heard.",
    "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\nBingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy,\nwithout calling her attention.",
    "This observation would not have pre-\nvented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated\nat an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the ne-\ncessity of saying much.",
    "Her own thoughts were employing her.",
    "She\nexpected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the\nroom.",
    "She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be\namongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could\nscarcely determine.",
    "After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour\nwithout hearing Miss Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiv-\ning from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family.",
    "She answered\nwith equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.",
    "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the ﬁnest\nfruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a signiﬁcant\nlook and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to\nremind her of her post.",
    "There was now employment for the whole\nparty—for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\nthem round the table.",
    "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\nwhether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy,\nby the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then,\nthough but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predomi-\nnate, she began to regret that he came.",
    "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three\nother gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had\nleft him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit\n185\nto Georgiana that morning.",
    "No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth\nwisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution\nthe more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept,\nbecause she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened\nagainst them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch\nhis behaviour when he ﬁrst came into the room.",
    "In no countenance was\nattentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of\nthe smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over.",
    "Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.",
    "Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nﬁrst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\n“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Mery-\nton?",
    "They must be a great loss to your family.”\nIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name;\nbut Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her\nthoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her\na moment’s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-\nnatured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably\ndetached tone.",
    "While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her\nDarcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and\nhis sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.",
    "Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved\nfriend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she\nhad merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the\nidea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a\nsensibility which might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to\nremind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part\nof her family were connected with that corps.",
    "Not a syllable had ever\nreached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement.",
    "To no creature had\nit been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and\nfrom all Bingley’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to\nconceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed\nto him, of their becoming hereafter her own.",
    "He had certainly formed\nsuch a plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to\nseparate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add some-\nthing to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.",
    "Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emo-\n186\ntion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not ap-\nproach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though\nnot enough to be able to speak any more.",
    "Her brother, whose eye she\nfeared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the\nvery circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from\nElizabeth seemed to have ﬁxed them on her more and more cheerfully.",
    "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer\nabove mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their\ncarriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Eliza-\nbeth’s person, behaviour, and dress.",
    "But Georgiana would not join her.",
    "Her brother’s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his\njudgement could not err.",
    "And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth\nas to leave Georgiana without the power of ﬁnding her otherwise than\nlovely and amiable.",
    "When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley\ncould not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying\nto his sister.",
    "“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she\ncried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the\nwinter.",
    "She is grown so brown and coarse!",
    "Louisa and I were agreeing\nthat we should not have known her again.”\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he con-\ntented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alter-\nation than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of trav-\nelling in the summer.",
    "“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could\nsee any beauty in her.",
    "Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.",
    "Her nose wants\ncharacter—there is nothing marked in its lines.",
    "Her teeth are tolerable,\nbut not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have some-\ntimes been called so ﬁne, I could never see anything extraordinary in\nthem.",
    "They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and\nin her air altogether there is a self-sufﬁciency without fashion, which is\nintolerable.”\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this\nwas not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people\nare not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled,\nshe had all the success she expected.",
    "He was resolutely silent, however,\nand, from a determination of making him speak, she continued:\n“I remember, when we ﬁrst knew her in Hertfordshire, how\namazed we all were to ﬁnd that she was a reputed beauty; and I par-\nticularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at\n187\nNetherﬁeld, ‘ Shea beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But\nafterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought\nher rather pretty at one time.”\n“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but\nthatwas only when I ﬁrst saw her, for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction\nof having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred dur-\ning their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly inter-\nested them both.",
    "The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen\nwere discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their\nattention.",
    "They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit—of\neverything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.\nGardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly\ngratiﬁed by her niece’s beginning the subject.",
    "Chapter 46\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not ﬁnding a letter\nfrom Jane on their ﬁrst arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment\nhad been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent\nthere; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justiﬁed, by\nthe receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked\nthat it had been missent elsewhere.",
    "Elizabeth was not surprised at it,\nas Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.",
    "They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\nher uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by them-\nselves.",
    "The one missent must ﬁrst be attended to; it had been written\nﬁve days ago.",
    "The beginning contained an account of all their little\nparties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but\nthe latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agi-\ntation, gave more important intelligence.",
    "It was to this effect:\n“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\nof a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming\nyou—be assured that we are all well.",
    "What I have to say relates to\npoor Lydia.",
    "An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all\ngone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off\nto Scotland with one of his ofﬁcers; to own the truth, with Wickham!",
    "188\nImagine our surprise.",
    "To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly\nunexpected.",
    "I am very, very sorry.",
    "So imprudent a match on both\nsides!",
    "But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been\nmisunderstood.",
    "Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him,\nbut this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.",
    "His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can\ngive her nothing.",
    "Our poor mother is sadly grieved.",
    "My father bears it\nbetter.",
    "How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been\nsaid against him; we must forget it ourselves.",
    "They were off Saturday\nnight about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday\nmorning at eight.",
    "The express was sent off directly.",
    "My dear Lizzy,\nthey must have passed within ten miles of us.",
    "Colonel Forster gives\nus reason to expect him here soon.",
    "Lydia left a few lines for his wife,\ninforming her of their intention.",
    "I must conclude, for I cannot be long\nfrom my poor mother.",
    "I am afraid you will not be able to make it out,\nbut I hardly know what I have written.”\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\nknowing what she felt, Elizabeth on ﬁnishing this letter instantly\nseized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as\nfollows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the ﬁrst.",
    "“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried let-\nter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not conﬁned for\ntime, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coher-\nent.",
    "Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad\nnews for you, and it cannot be delayed.",
    "Imprudent as the marriage\nbetween Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anx-\nious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason\nto fear they are not gone to Scotland.",
    "Colonel Forster came yesterday,\nhaving left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.",
    "Though Lydia’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that\nthey were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny\nexpressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry\nLydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking\nthe alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route.",
    "He did trace\nthem easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they\nremoved into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought\nthem from Epsom.",
    "All that is known after this is, that they were seen\nto continue the London road.",
    "I know not what to think.",
    "After mak-\ning every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on\ninto Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and\n189\nat the inns in Barnet and Hatﬁeld, but without any success—no such\npeople had been seen to pass through.",
    "With the kindest concern he\ncame on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a man-\nner most creditable to his heart.",
    "I am sincerely grieved for him and\nMrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them.",
    "Our distress, my\ndear Lizzy, is very great.",
    "My father and mother believe the worst, but I\ncannot think so ill of him.",
    "Many circumstances might make it more eli-\ngible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their ﬁrst\nplan; and even if hecould form such a design against a young woman\nof Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to\neverything?",
    "Impossible!",
    "I grieve to ﬁnd, however, that Colonel F. is\nnot disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when\nI expressed my hopes, and said he fear W. was not a man to be trusted.",
    "My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room.",
    "Could she exert her-\nself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected.",
    "And as to my\nfather, I never in my life saw him so affected.",
    "Poor Kitty has anger\nfor having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of con-\nﬁdence, one cannot wonder.",
    "I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as\nthe ﬁrst shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?",
    "I am not\nso selﬁsh, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.",
    "Adieu!",
    "I take up\nmy pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circum-\nstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come\nhere as soon as possible.",
    "I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that\nI am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\nask of the former.",
    "My father is going to London with Colonel Forster\ninstantly, to try to discover her.",
    "What he means to do I am sure I know\nnot; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any mea-\nsure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at\nBrighton again to-morrow evening.",
    "In such an exigence, my uncle’s\nadvice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will imme-\ndiately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”\n“Oh!",
    "where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from\nher seat as she ﬁnished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without\nlosing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door\nit was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.",
    "Her pale face\nand impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover\nhimself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by\nLydia’s situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must\nleave you.",
    "I must ﬁnd Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that\n190\ncannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.”\n“Good God!",
    "what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\nbut let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.",
    "You are\nnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt\nhow little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.",
    "Call-\ning back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so\nbreathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his mas-\nter and mistress home instantly.",
    "On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself,\nand looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave\nher, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commisera-\ntion, “Let me call your maid.",
    "Is there nothing you could take to give\nyou present relief?",
    "A glass of wine; shall I get you one?",
    "You are very\nill.”\n“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.",
    "“There is nothing the matter with me.",
    "I am quite well; I am only dis-\ntressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Long-\nbourn.”\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\nnot speak another word.",
    "Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\nsomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassion-\nate silence.",
    "At length she spoke again.",
    "“I have just had a letter from\nJane, with such dreadful news.",
    "It cannot be concealed from anyone.",
    "My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown her-\nself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham.",
    "They are gone off together\nfrom Brighton.",
    "Youknow him too well to doubt the rest.",
    "She has no\nmoney, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for\never.”\nDarcy was ﬁxed in astonishment.",
    "“When I consider,” she added in\na yet more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it!",
    "I, who knew\nwhat he was.",
    "Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of\nwhat I learnt, to my own family!",
    "Had his character been known, this\ncould not have happened.",
    "But it is all—all too late now.”\n“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved—shocked.",
    "But is it\ncertain—absolutely certain?”\n“Oh, yes!",
    "They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were\ntraced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone\nto Scotland.”\n“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\n191\nher?”\n“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my un-\ncle’s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour.",
    "But nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done.",
    "How is such a man to be worked on?",
    "How are they even to be discov-\nered?",
    "I have not the smallest hope.",
    "It is every way horrible!”\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.",
    "“When myeyes were opened to his real character—Oh!",
    "had I\nknown what I ought, what I dared to do!",
    "But I knew not—I was afraid\nof doing too much.",
    "Wretched, wretched mistake!”\nDarcy made no answer.",
    "He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was\nwalking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow con-\ntracted, his air gloomy.",
    "Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly under-\nstood it.",
    "Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a\nproof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.",
    "She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-\nconquest brought nothing to her consolatory to her bosom, afforded\nno palliation of her distress.",
    "It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated\nto make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so hon-\nestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be\nvain.",
    "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.",
    "Lydia—the\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\nup every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several\nminutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of\nher companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion,\nspoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been long desiring\nmy absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real,\nthough unavailing concern.",
    "Would to Heaven that anything could be\neither said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such\ndistress!",
    "But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem\npurposely to ask for your thanks.",
    "This unfortunate affair will, I fear,\nprevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-\nday.”\n“Oh, yes.",
    "Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.",
    "Say that\nurgent business calls us home immediately.",
    "Conceal the unhappy truth\nas long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sor-\nrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at\npresent reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations,\n192\nwith only one serious, parting look, went away.",
    "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that\nthey should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\nhad marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw\na retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feel-\nings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would for-\nmerly have rejoiced in its termination.",
    "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Eliza-\nbeth’s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.",
    "But\nif otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable\nor unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising\non a ﬁrst interview with its object, and even before two words have\nbeen exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she\nhad given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for\nWickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek\nthe other less interesting mode of attachment.",
    "Be that as it may, she\nsaw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s in-\nfamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reﬂected on that\nwretched business.",
    "Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had she\nentertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her.",
    "No one but\nJane, she thought, could ﬂatter herself with such an expectation.",
    "Sur-\nprise was the least of her feelings on this development.",
    "While the con-\ntents of the ﬁrst letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise—all\nastonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossi-\nble he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached\nhim had appeared incomprehensible.",
    "But now it was all too natural.",
    "For such an attachment as this she might have sufﬁcient charms; and\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an\nelopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difﬁculty in\nbelieving that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve\nher from falling an easy prey.",
    "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,\nthat Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.",
    "Sometimes\none ofﬁcer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their atten-\ntions raised them in her opinion.",
    "Her affections had continually been\nﬂuctuating but never without an object.",
    "The mischief of neglect and\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl—oh!",
    "how acutely did she\nnow feel it!",
    "She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot\n193\nto share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her,\nin a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exer-\ntion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded\nthat nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed\nof the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience\nwas severe.",
    "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, suppos-\ning by the servant’s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling\non the postscript of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had\nnever been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not\nbut be deeply afﬂicted.",
    "Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it;\nand after the ﬁrst exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner\npromised every assistance in his power.",
    "Elizabeth, though expecting\nno less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being ac-\ntuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\nsettled.",
    "They were to be off as soon as possible.",
    "“But what is to be done\nabout Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner.",
    "“John told us Mr. Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us; was it so?”\n“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.",
    "That is all settled.”\n“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room\nto prepare.",
    "“And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the\nreal truth?",
    "Oh, that I knew how it was!”\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in\nthe hurry and confusion of the following hour.",
    "Had Elizabeth been at\nleisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employ-\nment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her\nshare of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were\nnotes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses\nfor their sudden departure.",
    "An hour, however, saw the whole com-\npleted; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the\ninn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the\nmisery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than\nshe could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to\nLongbourn.",
    "194\nChapter 47\n“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as\nthey drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I\nam much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does\non the matter.",
    "It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man\nshould form such a design against a girl who is by no means unpro-\ntected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s fam-\nily, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.",
    "Could he expect that\nher friends would not step forward?",
    "Could he expect to be noticed\nagain by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?",
    "His\ntemptation is not adequate to the risk!”\n“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a mo-\nment.",
    "“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\nopinion.",
    "It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and inter-\nest, for him to be guilty of.",
    "I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.",
    "Can\nyou yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable\nof it?”\n“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\nneglect I can believe him capable.",
    "If, indeed, it should be so!",
    "But I dare\nnot hope it.",
    "Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the\ncase?”\n“In the ﬁrst place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.”\n“Oh!",
    "but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\nsuch a presumption!",
    "And, besides, no traces of them were to be found\non the Barnet road.”\n“Well, then—supposing them to be in London.",
    "They may be there,\nthough for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional pur-\npose.",
    "It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either\nside; and it might strike them that they could be more economically,\nthough less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”\n“But why all this secrecy?",
    "Why any fear of detection?",
    "Why must\ntheir marriage be private?",
    "Oh, no, no—this is not likely.",
    "His most par-\nticular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never\nintending to marry her.",
    "Wickham will never marry a woman without\nsome money.",
    "He cannot afford it.",
    "And what claims has Lydia—what\nattraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could\nmake him, for her sake, forego every chance of beneﬁting himself by\nmarrying well?",
    "As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in\n195\nthe corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not\nable to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might\nproduce.",
    "But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold\ngood.",
    "Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine,\nfrom my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention\nhe has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family,\nthat hewould do as little, and think as little about it, as any father\ncould do, in such a matter.”\n“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of\nhim as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”\n“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth,\nwith tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in\nsuch a point should admit of doubt.",
    "But, really, I know not what to say.",
    "Perhaps I am not doing her justice.",
    "But she is very young; she has never\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay,\nfor a twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement\nand vanity.",
    "She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most\nidle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her\nway.",
    "Since the ——shire were ﬁrst quartered in Meryton, nothing but\nlove, ﬂirtation, and ofﬁcers have been in her head.",
    "She has been doing\neverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\ngreater—what shall I call it?",
    "susceptibility to her feelings; which are\nnaturally lively enough.",
    "And we all know that Wickham has every\ncharm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”\n“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of\nWickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\n“Of whom does Jane ever think ill?",
    "And who is there, whatever\nmight be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an\nattempt, till it were proved against them?",
    "But Jane knows, as well as I\ndo, what Wickham really is.",
    "We both know that he has been proﬂigate\nin every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour;\nthat he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\n“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\ncuriosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.",
    "“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring.",
    "“I told you, the other\nday, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when\nlast at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who\nhad behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.",
    "And\nthere are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not\nworth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are\nendless.",
    "From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared\n196\nto see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.",
    "Yet he knew to the contrary\nhimself.",
    "He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as\nwe have found her.”\n“But does Lydia know nothing of this?",
    "can she be ignorant of what\nyou and Jane seem so well to understand?”\n“Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all.",
    "Till I was in Kent, and saw\nso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\nignorant of the truth myself.",
    "And when I returned home, the ——shire\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time.",
    "As that was the\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it neces-\nsary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently\nbe to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had\nof him should then be overthrown?",
    "And even when it was settled that\nLydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes\nto his character never occurred to me.",
    "That shecould be in any danger\nfrom the deception never entered my head.",
    "That such a consequence\nasthiscould ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my\nthoughts.”\n“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason,\nI suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\n“Not the slightest.",
    "I can remember no symptom of affection on ei-\nther side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must\nbe aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away.",
    "When ﬁrst he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him;\nbut so we all were.",
    "Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses\nabout him for the ﬁrst two months; but he never distinguished herby\nany particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period\nof extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and\nothers of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again\nbecame her favourites.”\n* * * * *\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be\nadded to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject,\nby its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long,\nduring the whole of the journey.",
    "From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was\nnever absent.",
    "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach,\nshe could ﬁnd no interval of ease or forgetfulness.",
    "They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night\non the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.",
    "It was a\n197\ncomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\nby long expectations.",
    "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were stand-\ning on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when\nthe carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up\ntheir faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\ncapers and frisks, was the ﬁrst pleasing earnest of their welcome.",
    "Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from\nher mother’s apartment, immediately met her.",
    "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears ﬁlled the\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\nheard of the fugitives.",
    "“Not yet,” replied Jane.",
    "“But now that my dear uncle is come, I\nhope everything will be well.”\n“Is my father in town?”\n“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\n“And have you heard from him often?”\n“We have heard only twice.",
    "He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday\nto say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which\nI particularly begged him to do.",
    "He merely added that he should not\nwrite again till he had something of importance to mention.”\n“And my mother—how is she?",
    "How are you all?”\n“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\nshaken.",
    "She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\nall.",
    "She does not yet leave her dressing-room.",
    "Mary and Kitty, thank\nHeaven, are quite well.”\n“But you—how are you?” cried Elizabeth.",
    "“You look pale.",
    "How\nmuch you must have gone through!”\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\ntheir conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gar-\ndiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the\napproach of the whole party.",
    "Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and wel-\ncomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.",
    "When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Eliz-\nabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and\nthey soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.",
    "The sanguine\nhope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested\nhad not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well,\nand that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or\nher father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their\n198\nmarriage.",
    "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\nminutes’ conversation together, received them exactly as might be ex-\npected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the\nvillainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings\nand ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging\nindulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.",
    "“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to\nBrighton, with all my family, thiswould not have happened; but poor\ndear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.",
    "Why did the Forsters ever\nlet her go out of their sight?",
    "I am sure there was some great neglect or\nother on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if\nshe had been well looked after.",
    "I always thought they were very unﬁt\nto have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am.",
    "Poor\ndear child!",
    "And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will\nﬁght Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\nwhat is to become of us all?",
    "The Collinses will turn us out before he is\ncold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know\nwhat we shall do.”\nThey all exclaimed against such terriﬁc ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\nafter general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told\nher that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist\nMr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.",
    "“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to\nbe prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.",
    "It\nis not quite a week since they left Brighton.",
    "In a few days more we may\ngain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\nlost.",
    "As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult\ntogether as to what is to be done.”\n“Oh!",
    "my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what\nI could most wish for.",
    "And now do, when you get to town, ﬁnd them\nout, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make\nthem marry.",
    "And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that,\nbut tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy\nthem, after they are married.",
    "And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from\nﬁghting.",
    "Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted\nout of my wits—and have such tremblings, such ﬂutterings, all over\nme—such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings\nat heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.",
    "And tell my dear\n199\nLydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\nfor she does not know which are the best warehouses.",
    "Oh, brother,\nhow kind you are!",
    "I know you will contrive it all.”\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest en-\ndeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to\nher, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this\nmanner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feel-\nings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.",
    "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\nreal occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt\nto oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold\nher tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged\nit better that oneonly of the household, and the one whom they could\nmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the sub-\nject.",
    "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who\nhad been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their\nappearance before.",
    "One came from her books, and the other from\nher toilette.",
    "The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no\nchange was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister,\nor the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given\nmore of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty.",
    "As for Mary, she\nwas mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a counte-\nnance of grave reﬂection, soon after they were seated at table:\n“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked\nof.",
    "But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded\nbosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\n“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this\nuseful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one\nfalse step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less\nbrittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in\nher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much op-\npressed to make any reply.",
    "Mary, however, continued to console her-\nself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.",
    "In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of\nthe opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally ea-\nger to satisfy.",
    "After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful\nsequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and\n200\nMiss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former con-\ntinued the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it\nwhich I have not already heard.",
    "Give me further particulars.",
    "What did\nColonel Forster say?",
    "Had they no apprehension of anything before the\nelopement took place?",
    "They must have seen them together for ever.”\n“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partial-\nity, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm.",
    "I\nam so grieved for him!",
    "His behaviour was attentive and kind to the\nutmost.",
    "He wascoming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, be-\nfore he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that\napprehension ﬁrst got abroad, it hastened his journey.”\n“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?",
    "Did\nhe know of their intending to go off?",
    "Had Colonel Forster seen Denny\nhimself?”\n“Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing any-\nthing of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it.",
    "He\ndid not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I\nam inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”\n“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained\na doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”\n“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?",
    "I\nfelt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright.",
    "My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\nimprudent a match it must be.",
    "Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter\nshe had prepared her for such a step.",
    "She had known, it seems, of their\nbeing in love with each other, many weeks.”\n“But not before they went to Brighton?”\n“No, I believe not.”\n“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?",
    "Does he know his real character?”\n“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he for-\nmerly did.",
    "He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.",
    "And\nsince this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton\ngreatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.”\n“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of\nhim, this could not have happened!”\n“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.",
    "“But to\nexpose the former faults of any person without knowing what their\npresent feelings were, seemed unjustiﬁable.",
    "We acted with the best\n201\nintentions.”\n“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his\nwife?”\n“He brought it with him for us to see.”\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.",
    "These were the contents:\n“My dear Harriet ,\n“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\nlaughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\nmissed.",
    "I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,\nI shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I\nlove, and he is an angel.",
    "I should never be happy without him, so think\nit no harm to be off.",
    "You need not send them word at Longbourn of\nmy going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,\nwhen I write to them and sign my name ‘Lydia Wickham.’ What a\ngood joke it will be!",
    "I can hardly write for laughing.",
    "Pray make my\nexcuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with\nhim to-night.",
    "Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all;\nand tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great\npleasure.",
    "I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I\nwish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin\ngown before they are packed up.",
    "Good-bye.",
    "Give my love to Colonel\nForster.",
    "I hope you will drink to our good journey.",
    "“Your affectionate friend,\n“Lydia Bennet .”\n“Oh!",
    "thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she\nhad ﬁnished it.",
    "“What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!",
    "But at least it shows that shewas serious on the subject of their journey.",
    "Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side\nascheme of infamy.",
    "My poor father!",
    "how he must have felt it!”\n“I never saw anyone so shocked.",
    "He could not speak a word for\nfull ten minutes.",
    "My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole\nhouse in such confusion!”\n“Oh!",
    "Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it\nwho did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\n“I do not know.",
    "I hope there was.",
    "But to be guarded at such a time is\nvery difﬁcult.",
    "My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured\nto give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so\n202\nmuch as I might have done!",
    "But the horror of what might possibly\nhappen almost took from me my faculties.”\n“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.",
    "You do not\nlook well.",
    "Oh that I had been with you!",
    "you have had every care and\nanxiety upon yourself alone.”\n“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\nevery fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.",
    "Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours\nof repose should not be broken in on.",
    "My aunt Phillips came to Long-\nbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to\nstay till Thursday with me.",
    "She was of great use and comfort to us all.",
    "And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday\nmorning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her\ndaughters’, if they should be of use to us.”\n“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps\nshemeant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see\ntoo little of one’s neighbours.",
    "Assistance is impossible; condolence in-\nsufferable.",
    "Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisﬁed.”\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father\nhad intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.",
    "“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place\nwhere they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything\ncould be made out from them.",
    "His principal object must be to discover\nthe number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.",
    "It\nhad come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the cir-\ncumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into\nanother might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.",
    "If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before\nset down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it\nmight not be impossible to ﬁnd out the stand and number of the coach.",
    "I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in\nsuch a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I\nhad difﬁculty in ﬁnding out even so much as this.”\nChapter 48\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.",
    "His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent\nand dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exer-\n203\ntion.",
    "They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence\nto send; but even of thatthey would have been glad to be certain.",
    "Mr.\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.",
    "When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\ninformation of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at part-\ning, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he\ncould, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the\nonly security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a\nfew days longer, as the former thought her presence might be service-\nable to her nieces.",
    "She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and\nwas a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.",
    "Their other aunt\nalso visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\ncheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without\nreporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregular-\nity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than\nshe found them.",
    "All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\nmonths before, had been almost an angel of light.",
    "He was declared to\nbe in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all hon-\noured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every trades-\nman’s family.",
    "Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young\nman in the world; and everybody began to ﬁnd out that they had al-\nways distrusted the appearance of his goodness.",
    "Elizabeth, though she\ndid not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make\nher former assurance of her sister’s ruin more certain; and even Jane,\nwho believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially\nas the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which\nshe had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability\nhave gained some news of them.",
    "Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife re-\nceived a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had\nimmediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to\nGracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham,\nbefore his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information;\nand that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in\ntown, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of\nthem, on their ﬁrst coming to London, before they procured lodgings.",
    "Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure,\nbut as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing\nit.",
    "He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to\n204\nleave London and promised to write again very soon.",
    "There was also\na postscript to this effect:\n“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to ﬁnd out, if possi-\nble, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment, whether\nWickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\nknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself.",
    "If there\nwere anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such\na clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.",
    "At present we have\nnothing to guide us.",
    "Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\nhis power to satisfy us on this head.",
    "But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any\nother person.”\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference\nto her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any\ninformation of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.",
    "She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father\nand mother, both of whom had been dead many years.",
    "It was possible,\nhowever, that some of his companions in the ——shire might be able\nto give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in\nexpecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.",
    "Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\nanxious part of each was when the post was expected.",
    "The arrival of\nletters was the grand object of every morning’s impatience.",
    "Through\nletters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communi-\ncated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of\nimportance.",
    "But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she\naccordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters\nalways were, looked over her, and read it likewise.",
    "It was as follows:\n“My dear sir ,\n“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in\nlife, to condole with you on the grievous afﬂiction you are now suf-\nfering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from\nHertfordshire.",
    "Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself\nsincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your\npresent distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceed-\ning from a cause which no time can remove.",
    "No arguments shall be\nwanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that\n205\nmay comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the\nmost afﬂicting to a parent’s mind.",
    "The death of your daughter would\nhave been a blessing in comparison of this.",
    "And it is the more to be\nlamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte in-\nforms me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has\nproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same\ntime, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined\nto think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could\nnot be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.",
    "Howsoever that\nmay be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not\nonly joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter, to whom I have related the affair.",
    "They agree with me in ap-\nprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the\nfortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself conde-\nscendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?",
    "And this\nconsideration leads me moreover to reﬂect, with augmented satisfac-\ntion, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I\nmust have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.",
    "Let me then\nadvise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw\noff your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\nreap the fruits of her own heinous offense.",
    "“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\nfrom Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to\nsend.",
    "It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with\nwhom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no\nnear one living.",
    "His former acquaintances had been numerous; but\nsince he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms\nof particular friendship with any of them.",
    "There was no one, there-\nfore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.",
    "And\nin the wretched state of his own ﬁnances, there was a very powerful\nmotive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s re-\nlations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind\nhim to a very considerable amount.",
    "Colonel Forster believed that more\nthan a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at\nBrighton.",
    "He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were\nstill more formidable.",
    "Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these\nparticulars from the Longbourn family.",
    "Jane heard them with horror.",
    "“A gamester!” she cried.",
    "“This is wholly unexpected.",
    "I had not an idea\nof it.”\n206\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their\nfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday.",
    "Rendered\nspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his\nbrother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave\nit to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for\ncontinuing their pursuit.",
    "When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.",
    "“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried.",
    "“Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.",
    "Who is to\nﬁght Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?”\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that\nshe and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.\nBennet came from it.",
    "The coach, therefore, took them the ﬁrst stage of\ntheir journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.",
    "Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and\nher Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the\nworld.",
    "His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them\nby her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner\nhad formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in\nnothing.",
    "Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come\nfrom Pemberley.",
    "The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse\nfor the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\nfairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread\nof Lydia’s infamy somewhat better.",
    "It would have spared her, she\nthought, one sleepless night out of two.",
    "When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\nphilosophic composure.",
    "He said as little as he had ever been in the\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\naway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak\nof it.",
    "It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her brieﬂy\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say\nnothing of that.",
    "Who should suffer but myself?",
    "It has been my own\ndoing, and I ought to feel it.”\n“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.",
    "“You may well warn me against such an evil.",
    "Human nature is so\n207\nprone to fall into it!",
    "No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much\nI have been to blame.",
    "I am not afraid of being overpowered by the\nimpression.",
    "It will pass away soon enough.”\n“Do you suppose them to be in London?”\n“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\n“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.",
    "“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there\nwill probably be of some duration.”\nThen after a short silence he continued:\n“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justiﬁed in your advice to\nme last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of\nmind.”\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\nmother’s tea.",
    "“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such\nan elegance to misfortune!",
    "Another day I will do the same; I will sit\nin my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much\ntrouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”\n“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully.",
    "“If I should\never go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\n“Yougo to Brighton.",
    "I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne\nfor ﬁfty pounds!",
    "No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and\nyou will feel the effects of it.",
    "No ofﬁcer is ever to enter into my house\nagain, nor even to pass through the village.",
    "Balls will be absolutely\nprohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.",
    "And you are\nnever to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten\nminutes of every day in a rational manner.”\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.",
    "“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy.",
    "If you are a\ngood girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end\nof them.”\nChapter 49\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\nwalking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the\nhousekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to\ncall them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of\nthe expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss\nBennet, “I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in\n208\nhopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the\nliberty of coming to ask.”\n“What do you mean, Hill?",
    "We have heard nothing from town.”\n“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you\nknow there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?",
    "He has\nbeen here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.",
    "They\nran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\nlibrary; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seek-\ning him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler,\nwho said:\n“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards\nthe little copse.”\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once\nmore, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately\npursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.",
    "Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running\nas Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out:\n“Oh, papa, what news—what news?",
    "Have you heard from my un-\ncle?”\n“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”\n“Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?”\n“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter\nfrom his pocket.",
    "“But perhaps you would like to read it.”\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.",
    "Jane now came up.",
    "“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it\nis about.”\n“Gracechurch Street, Monday,\nAugust 2.",
    "“My dear brother ,\n“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\nas, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.",
    "Soon after you\nleft me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to ﬁnd out in what part of\nLondon they were.",
    "The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough\nto know they are discovered.",
    "I have seen them both—”\n“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”\nElizabeth read on:\n209\n“I have seen them both.",
    "They are not married, nor can I ﬁnd there\nwas any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the\nengagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it\nwill not be long before they are.",
    "All that is required of you is, to assure\nto your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the ﬁve thousand\npounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and\nmy sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,\nduring your life, one hundred pounds per annum.",
    "These are condi-\ntions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\nwith, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.",
    "I shall send this by\nexpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.",
    "You\nwill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s\ncircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to\nbe.",
    "The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\nsay there will be some little money, even when all his debts are dis-\ncharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.",
    "If, as I\nconclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name\nthroughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give direc-\ntions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.",
    "There will not\nbe the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay\nquiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.",
    "Send back\nyour answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.",
    "We\nhave judged it best that my niece should be married from this house,\nof which I hope you will approve.",
    "She comes to us to-day.",
    "I shall write\nagain as soon as anything more is determined on.",
    "Yours, etc.,\n“Edw.",
    "Gardiner.",
    "”\n“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had ﬁnished.",
    "“Can it be\npossible that he will marry her?”\n“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said\nher sister.",
    "“My dear father, I congratulate you.”\n“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.",
    "“No; but it must be done soon.”\nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time be-\nfore he wrote.",
    "“Oh!",
    "my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.",
    "Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”\n“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble your-\nself.”\n“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”\n210\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the\nhouse.",
    "“And may I ask—” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must\nbe complied with.”\n“Complied with!",
    "I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”\n“And they must marry!",
    "Yet he is such a man!”\n“Yes, yes, they must marry.",
    "There is nothing else to be done.",
    "But\nthere are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much\nmoney your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how\nam I ever to pay him.”\n“Money!",
    "My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”\n“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight\na temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and ﬁfty after I am\ngone.”\n“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to\nme before.",
    "His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!",
    "Oh!",
    "it must be my uncle’s doings!",
    "Generous, good man, I am afraid he\nhas distressed himself.",
    "A small sum could not do all this.”\n“No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a far-\nthing less than ten thousand pounds.",
    "I should be sorry to think so ill\nof him, in the very beginning of our relationship.”\n“Ten thousand pounds!",
    "Heaven forbid!",
    "How is half such a sum to\nbe repaid?”\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\ncontinued silent till they reached the house.",
    "Their father then went on\nto the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.",
    "“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\nwere by themselves.",
    "“How strange this is!",
    "And for thiswe are to be\nthankful.",
    "That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\nand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice.",
    "Oh, Lydia!”\n“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly\nwould not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.",
    "Though our\nkind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe\nthat ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.",
    "He\nhas children of his own, and may have more.",
    "How could he spare half\nten thousand pounds?”\n“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,”\nsaid Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister,\nwe shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because\nWickham has not sixpence of his own.",
    "The kindness of my uncle and\naunt can never be requited.",
    "Their taking her home, and affording her\n211\ntheir personal protection and countenance, is such a sacriﬁce to her\nadvantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.",
    "By this\ntime she is actually with them!",
    "If such goodness does not make her\nmiserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!",
    "What a meeting\nfor her, when she ﬁrst sees my aunt!”\n“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,”\nsaid Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy.",
    "His consenting to\nmarry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\nthinking.",
    "Their mutual affection will steady them; and I ﬂatter myself\nthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\ntime make their past imprudence forgotten.”\n“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you,\nnor I, nor anybody can ever forget.",
    "It is useless to talk of it.”\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened.",
    "They went to the library,\ntherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to\nmake it known to her.",
    "He was writing and, without raising his head,\ncoolly replied:\n“Just as you please.”\n“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”\n“Take whatever you like, and get away.”\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up-\nstairs together.",
    "Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one com-\nmunication would, therefore, do for all.",
    "After a slight preparation for\ngood news, the letter was read aloud.",
    "Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain\nherself.",
    "As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being\nsoon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added\nto its exuberance.",
    "She was now in an irritation as violent from delight,\nas she had ever been ﬁdgety from alarm and vexation.",
    "To know that\nher daughter would be married was enough.",
    "She was disturbed by no\nfear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her miscon-\nduct.",
    "“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried.",
    "“This is delightful indeed!",
    "She\nwill be married!",
    "I shall see her again!",
    "She will be married at sixteen!",
    "My good, kind brother!",
    "I knew how it would be.",
    "I knew he would\nmanage everything!",
    "How I long to see her!",
    "and to see dear Wickham\ntoo!",
    "But the clothes, the wedding clothes!",
    "I will write to my sister\nGardiner about them directly.",
    "Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father,\nand ask him how much he will give her.",
    "Stay, stay, I will go myself.",
    "Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.",
    "I will put on my things in a moment.",
    "My\ndear, dear Lydia!",
    "How merry we shall be together when we meet!”\n212\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence\nof these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which\nMr. Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.",
    "“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a\ngreat measure to his kindness.",
    "We are persuaded that he has pledged\nhimself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.”\n“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but\nher own uncle?",
    "If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\nmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the ﬁrst time we have\never had anything from him, except a few presents.",
    "Well!",
    "I am so\nhappy!",
    "In a short time I shall have a daughter married.",
    "Mrs. Wickham!",
    "How well it sounds!",
    "And she was only sixteen last June.",
    "My dear\nJane, I am in such a ﬂutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate,\nand you write for me.",
    "We will settle with your father about the money\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders,\nhad not Jane, though with some difﬁculty, persuaded her to wait till her\nfather was at leisure to be consulted.",
    "One day’s delay, she observed,\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be\nquite so obstinate as usual.",
    "Other schemes, too, came into her head.",
    "“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell\nthe good, good news to my sister Philips.",
    "And as I come back, I can call\non Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.",
    "Kitty, run down and order the carriage.",
    "An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.",
    "Girls, can I\ndo anything for you in Meryton?",
    "Oh!",
    "Here comes Hill!",
    "My dear Hill,\nhave you heard the good news?",
    "Miss Lydia is going to be married; and\nyou shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.",
    "Elizabeth received\nher congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.",
    "Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was\nno worse, she had need to be thankful.",
    "She felt it so; and though,\nin looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosper-\nity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they\nhad feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they\nhad gained.",
    "213\nChapter 50\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum\nfor the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\nhim.",
    "He now wished it more than ever.",
    "Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever\nof honour or credit could now be purchased for her.",
    "The satisfaction of\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\nbe her husband might then have rested in its proper place.",
    "He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\nanyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law,\nand he was determined, if possible, to ﬁnd out the extent of his assis-\ntance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.",
    "When ﬁrst Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be per-\nfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.",
    "The son was to\njoin in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the\nwidow and younger children would by that means be provided for.",
    "Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to\ncome; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been\ncertain that he would.",
    "This event had at last been despaired of, but it\nwas then too late to be saving.",
    "Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy,\nand her husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their ex-\nceeding their income.",
    "Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Ben-\nnet and the children.",
    "But in what proportions it should be divided\namongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.",
    "This was one\npoint, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and\nMr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal be-\nfore him.",
    "In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his\nbrother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper\nhis perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to ful-\nﬁl the engagements that had been made for him.",
    "He had never before\nsupposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daugh-\nter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the\npresent arrangement.",
    "He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser\nby the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and\npocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed\nto her through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very\nlittle within that sum.",
    "That it would be done with such triﬂing exertion on his side, too,\n214\nwas another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have\nas little trouble in the business as possible.",
    "When the ﬁrst transports\nof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence.",
    "His letter was soon dis-\npatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\nits execution.",
    "He begged to know further particulars of what he was\nindebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any mes-\nsage to her.",
    "The good news spread quickly through the house, and with pro-\nportionate speed through the neighbourhood.",
    "It was borne in the lat-\nter with decent philosophy.",
    "To be sure, it would have been more for\nthe advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the\ntown; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in\nsome distant farmhouse.",
    "But there was much to be talked of in mar-\nrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had\nproceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a\nlittle of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\nan husband her misery was considered certain.",
    "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\nthis happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\nspirits oppressively high.",
    "No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\ntriumph.",
    "The marriage of a daughter, which had been the ﬁrst object of\nher wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplish-\nment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants\nof elegant nuptials, ﬁne muslins, new carriages, and servants.",
    "She was\nbusily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for\nher daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income\nmight be, rejected many as deﬁcient in size and importance.",
    "“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it—or\nthe great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ash-\nworth is too far off!",
    "I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and\nas for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\nservants remained.",
    "But when they had withdrawn, he said to her:\n“Mrs.",
    "Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son\nand daughter, let us come to a right understanding.",
    "Into onehouse in\nthis neighbourhood they shall never have admittance.",
    "I will not en-\ncourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was ﬁrm.",
    "It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and\nhorror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes\n215\nfor his daughter.",
    "He protested that she should receive from him no\nmark of affection whatever on the occasion.",
    "Mrs. Bennet could hardly\ncomprehend it.",
    "That his anger could be carried to such a point of in-\nconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without\nwhich her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could\nbelieve possible.",
    "She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of\nnew clothes must reﬂect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense\nof shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before\nthey took place.",
    "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the dis-\ntress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their\nfears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the\nproper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on\nthe spot.",
    "She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.",
    "There\nwere few people on whose secrecy she would have more conﬁdently\ndepended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge\nof a sister’s frailty would have mortiﬁed her so much—not, however,\nfrom any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at\nany rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.",
    "Had Lydia’s\nmarriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not\nto be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family\nwhere, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and\nrelationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.",
    "From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.",
    "The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\nblow as this.",
    "She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though\nshe hardly knew of what.",
    "She became jealous of his esteem, when she\ncould no longer hope to be beneﬁted by it.",
    "She wanted to hear of him,\nwhen there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.",
    "She was\nconvinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no\nlonger likely they should meet.",
    "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that\nthe proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,\nwould now have been most gladly and gratefully received!",
    "He was as\ngenerous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while\nhe was mortal, there must be a triumph.",
    "She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her.",
    "His understanding and\n216\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.",
    "It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her\nease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners\nimproved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of\nthe world, she must have received beneﬁt of greater importance.",
    "But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring mul-\ntitude what connubial felicity really was.",
    "An union of a different\ntendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be\nformed in their family.",
    "How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable inde-\npendence, she could not imagine.",
    "But how little of permanent happi-\nness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because\ntheir passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjec-\nture.",
    "* * * * *\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.",
    "To Mr. Bennet’s ac-\nknowledgments he brieﬂy replied, with assurance of his eagerness to\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again.",
    "The princi-\npal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had\nresolved on quitting the militia.",
    "“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon\nas his marriage was ﬁxed on.",
    "And I think you will agree with me, in\nconsidering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on\nhis account and my niece’s.",
    "It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\nregulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are\nable and willing to assist him in the army.",
    "He has the promise of an en-\nsigncy in General ——’s regiment, now quartered in the North.",
    "It is an\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.",
    "He promises\nfairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a\ncharacter to preserve, they will both be more prudent.",
    "I have written to\nColonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to re-\nquest that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and\nnear Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\npledged myself.",
    "And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\na list according to his information?",
    "He has given in all his debts; I hope\nat least he has not deceived us.",
    "Haggerston has our directions, and all\nwill be completed in a week.",
    "They will then join his regiment, unless\nthey are ﬁrst invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gar-\n217\ndiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves\nthe South.",
    "She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and\nyour mother.—Yours, etc.,\n“E.",
    "Gardiner.",
    "”\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\nremoval from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.",
    "But\nMrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it.",
    "Lydia’s being settled in\nthe North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\ncompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing\nin Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was\nsuch a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was\nacquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.",
    "“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking\nto send her away!",
    "And there are several of the young men, too, that she\nlikes very much.",
    "The ofﬁcers may not be so pleasant in General——’s\nregiment.”\nHis daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being ad-\nmitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received\nat ﬁrst an absolute negative.",
    "But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in\nwishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and consequence, that\nshe should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so\nearnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her hus-\nband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was pre-\nvailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.",
    "And their\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished\nto the North.",
    "When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\nsent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.",
    "Eliza-\nbeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a\nscheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting\nwith him would have been the last object of her wishes.",
    "Chapter 51\nTheir sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for\nher probably more than she felt for herself.",
    "The carriage was sent to\nmeet them at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time.",
    "Their\n218\narrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more espe-\ncially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself,\nhad she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her\nsister must endure.",
    "They came.",
    "The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\nreceive them.",
    "Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage\ndrove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her\ndaughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.",
    "Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open,\nand she ran into the room.",
    "Her mother stepped forwards, embraced\nher, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affection-\nate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both\njoy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.",
    "Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was\nnot quite so cordial.",
    "His countenance rather gained in austerity; and\nhe scarcely opened his lips.",
    "The easy assurance of the young couple, in-\ndeed, was enough to provoke him.",
    "Elizabeth was disgusted, and even\nMiss Bennet was shocked.",
    "Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed,\nwild, noisy, and fearless.",
    "She turned from sister to sister, demanding\ntheir congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked\neagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\nobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\nthere.",
    "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his man-\nners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage\nbeen exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while\nhe claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.",
    "Elizabeth\nhad not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\ndown, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the im-\npudence of an impudent man.",
    "She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\ncolour.",
    "There was no want of discourse.",
    "The bride and her mother could\nneither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit\nnear Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neigh-\nbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to\nequal in her replies.",
    "They seemed each of them to have the happiest\nmemories in the world.",
    "Nothing of the past was recollected with pain;\nand Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have\nalluded to for the world.",
    "“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went\n219\naway; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\nenough happened in the time.",
    "Good gracious!",
    "when I went away, I am\nsure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!",
    "though\nI thought it would be very good fun if I was.”\nHer father lifted up his eyes.",
    "Jane was distressed.",
    "Elizabeth looked\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh!",
    "mamma, do\nthe people hereabouts know I am married to-day?",
    "I was afraid they\nmight not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was\ndetermined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to\nhim, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window\nframe, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\nanything.”\nElizabeth could bear it no longer.",
    "She got up, and ran out of the\nroom; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the\nhall to the dining parlour.",
    "She then joined them soon enough to see\nLydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and\nhear her say to her eldest sister, “Ah!",
    "Jane, I take your place now, and\nyou must go lower, because I am a married woman.”\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embar-\nrassment from which she had been so wholly free at ﬁrst.",
    "Her ease and\ngood spirits increased.",
    "She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases,\nand all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs.",
    "Wick-\nham” by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to\nshow her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two\nhousemaids.",
    "“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the break-\nfast room, “and what do you think of my husband?",
    "Is not he a charm-\ning man?",
    "I am sure my sisters must all envy me.",
    "I only hope they may\nhave half my good luck.",
    "They must all go to Brighton.",
    "That is the place\nto get husbands.",
    "What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”\n“Very true; and if I had my will, we should.",
    "But my dear Lydia, I\ndon’t at all like your going such a way off.",
    "Must it be so?”\n“Oh, lord!",
    "yes;—there is nothing in that.",
    "I shall like it of all things.",
    "You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.",
    "We shall\nbe at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls,\nand I will take care to get good partners for them all.”\n“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.",
    "“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\nsisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before\nthe winter is over.”\n220\n“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do\nnot particularly like your way of getting husbands.”\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.",
    "Mr.\nWickham had received his commission before he left London, and he\nwas to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.",
    "No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short;\nand she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter,\nand having very frequent parties at home.",
    "These parties were accept-\nable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as\ndid think, than such as did not.",
    "Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had ex-\npected to ﬁnd it; not equal to Lydia’s for him.",
    "She had scarcely needed\nher present observation to be satisﬁed, from the reason of things, that\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently car-\ning for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that\nhis ﬂight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if\nthat were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\nof having a companion.",
    "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.",
    "He was her dear Wickham on\nevery occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.",
    "He did\nevery thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more\nbirds on the ﬁrst of September, than any body else in the country.",
    "One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her\ntwo elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\n“Lizzy, I never gave youan account of my wedding, I believe.",
    "You\nwere not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.",
    "Are not\nyou curious to hear how it was managed?”\n“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said\non the subject.”\n“La!",
    "You are so strange!",
    "But I must tell you how it went off.",
    "We\nwere married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings\nwere in that parish.",
    "And it was settled that we should all be there by\neleven o’clock.",
    "My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the\nothers were to meet us at the church.",
    "Well, Monday morning came, and\nI was in such a fuss!",
    "I was so afraid, you know, that something would\nhappen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.",
    "And\nthere was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking\naway just as if she was reading a sermon.",
    "However, I did not hear\nabove one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my\ndear Wickham.",
    "I longed to know whether he would be married in his\n221\nblue coat.”\n“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would\nnever be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle\nand aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.",
    "If you’ll\nbelieve me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there\na fortnight.",
    "Not one party, or scheme, or anything.",
    "To be sure London\nwas rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.",
    "Well, and so\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\nbusiness to that horrid man Mr. Stone.",
    "And then, you know, when\nonce they get together, there is no end of it.",
    "Well, I was so frightened\nI did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and\nif we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.",
    "But,\nluckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set\nout.",
    "However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented\ngoing, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done\nas well.”\n“Mr.",
    "Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.",
    "“Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know.",
    "But\ngracious me!",
    "I quite forgot!",
    "I ought not to have said a word about it.",
    "I promised them so faithfully!",
    "What will Wickham say?",
    "It was to be\nsuch a secret!”\n“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\nsubject.",
    "You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\n“Oh!",
    "certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we\nwill ask you no questions.”\n“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\nall, and then Wickham would be angry.”\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out\nof her power, by running away.",
    "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least\nit was impossible not to try for information.",
    "Mr. Darcy had been at her\nsister’s wedding.",
    "It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.",
    "Con-\njectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain;\nbut she was satisﬁed with none.",
    "Those that best pleased her, as placing\nhis conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.",
    "She could\nnot bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a\nshort letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had\ndropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.",
    "“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity\nmust be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\n222\n(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been\namongst you at such a time.",
    "Pray write instantly, and let me under-\nstand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy\nwhich Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to\nbe satisﬁed with ignorance.”\n“Not that I shall, though,” she added to herself, as she ﬁnished the\nletter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable man-\nner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to ﬁnd it out.”\nJane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Eliz-\nabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till\nit appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she\nhad rather be without a conﬁdante.",
    "Chapter 52\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter\nas soon as she possibly could.",
    "She was no sooner in possession of it\nthan, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\ninterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be\nhappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain\na denial.",
    "“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.",
    "“My dear niece ,\n“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morn-\ning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise\nwhat I have to tell you.",
    "I must confess myself surprised by your ap-\nplication; I did not expect it from you.",
    "Don’t think me angry, however,\nfor I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries\nto be necessary on your side.",
    "If you do not choose to understand me,\nforgive my impertinence.",
    "Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—\nand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have\nallowed him to act as he has done.",
    "But if you are really innocent and\nignorant, I must be more explicit.",
    "“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your un-\ncle had a most unexpected visitor.",
    "Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up\nwith him several hours.",
    "It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity\nwas not so dreadfully racked as your’s seems to have been.",
    "He came\nto tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr.\n223\nWickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wick-\nham repeatedly, Lydia once.",
    "From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire\nonly one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of\nhunting for them.",
    "The motive professed was his conviction of its being\nowing to himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well\nknown as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to\nlove or conﬁde in him.",
    "He generously imputed the whole to his mis-\ntaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him\nto lay his private actions open to the world.",
    "His character was to speak\nfor itself.",
    "He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeav-\nour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.",
    "If he had\nanother motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.",
    "He had been\nsome days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had\nsomething to direct his search, which was more than wehad; and the\nconsciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.",
    "“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\ngoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some\ncause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.",
    "She then took a\nlarge house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by let-\nting lodgings.",
    "This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted\nwith Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as\nhe got to town.",
    "But it was two or three days before he could get from\nher what he wanted.",
    "She would not betray her trust, I suppose, with-\nout bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend\nwas to be found.",
    "Wickham indeed had gone to her on their ﬁrst ar-\nrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house,\nthey would have taken up their abode with her.",
    "At length, however,\nour kind friend procured the wished-for direction.",
    "They were in ——\nstreet.",
    "He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.",
    "His\nﬁrst object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to\nquit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon\nas they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance,\nas far as it would go.",
    "But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on re-\nmaining where she was.",
    "She cared for none of her friends; she wanted\nno help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.",
    "She was sure\nthey should be married some time or other, and it did not much sig-\nnify when.",
    "Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought,\nto secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very ﬁrst conversation\nwith Wickham, he easily learnt had never been hisdesign.",
    "He con-\nfessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts\nof honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the\n224\nill-consequences of Lydia’s ﬂight on her own folly alone.",
    "He meant to\nresign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\ncould conjecture very little about it.",
    "He must go somewhere, but he\ndid not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.",
    "“Mr.",
    "Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.",
    "Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\nbeen able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\nbeneﬁted by marriage.",
    "But he found, in reply to this question, that\nWickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his for-\ntune by marriage in some other country.",
    "Under such circumstances,\nhowever, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of imme-\ndiate relief.",
    "“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.",
    "Wick-\nham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was re-\nduced to be reasonable.",
    "“Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy’s next step\nwas to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he ﬁrst called in\nGracechurch street the evening before I came home.",
    "But Mr. Gardiner\ncould not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your\nfather was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.",
    "He\ndid not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\nconsult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till\nafter the departure of the former.",
    "He did not leave his name, and till the\nnext day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.",
    "“On Saturday he came again.",
    "Your father was gone, your uncle at\nhome, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.",
    "“They met again on Sunday, and then Isaw him too.",
    "It was not\nall settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off\nto Longbourn.",
    "But our visitor was very obstinate.",
    "I fancy, Lizzy, that\nobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all.",
    "He has been ac-\ncused of many faults at different times, but thisis the true one.",
    "Nothing\nwas to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do\nnot speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle\nwould most readily have settled the whole.",
    "“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than ei-\nther the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.",
    "But at last your\nuncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to\nhis niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of\nit, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\nthis morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explana-\ntion that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise\n225\nwhere it was due.",
    "But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or\nJane at most.",
    "“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the\nyoung people.",
    "His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to con-\nsiderably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition\nto her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased.",
    "The rea-\nson why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given\nabove.",
    "It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper con-\nsideration, that Wickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and\nconsequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.",
    "Per-\nhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether hisreserve,\noranybody’s reserve, can be answerable for the event.",
    "But in spite of\nall this ﬁne talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\nyour uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\nforanother interest in the affair.",
    "“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends,\nwho were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should\nbe in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money\nmatters were then to receive the last ﬁnish.",
    "“I believe I have now told you every thing.",
    "It is a relation which you\ntell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford\nyou any displeasure.",
    "Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant\nadmission to the house.",
    "Hewas exactly what he had been, when I knew\nhim in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisﬁed\nwith her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by\nJane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was\nexactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you\nno fresh pain.",
    "I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all\nthe unhappiness she had brought on her family.",
    "If she heard me, it was\nby good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.",
    "I was sometimes quite\nprovoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for\ntheir sakes had patience with her.",
    "“Mr.",
    "Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\nattended the wedding.",
    "He dined with us the next day, and was to leave\ntown again on Wednesday or Thursday.",
    "Will you be very angry with\nme, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was\nnever bold enough to say before) how much I like him.",
    "His behaviour\nto us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Der-\nbyshire.",
    "His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants noth-\ning but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently , his wife\n226\nmay teach him.",
    "I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned\nyour name.",
    "But slyness seems the fashion.",
    "“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy\ntill I have been all round the park.",
    "A low phaeton, with a nice little pair\nof ponies, would be the very thing.",
    "“But I must write no more.",
    "The children have been wanting me this\nhalf hour.",
    "“Yours, very sincerely,\n“M.",
    "Gardiner.",
    "”\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a ﬂutter of spirits, in\nwhich it was difﬁcult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\ngreatest share.",
    "The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty\nhad produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward\nher sister’s match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion\nof goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to\nbe just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their great-\nest extent to be true!",
    "He had followed them purposely to town, he\nhad taken on himself all the trouble and mortiﬁcation attendant on\nsuch a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman\nwhom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to\nmeet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and ﬁnally bribe, the\nman whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name\nit was punishment to him to pronounce.",
    "He had done all this for a\ngirl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.",
    "Her heart did whisper\nthat he had done it for her.",
    "But it was a hope shortly checked by other\nconsiderations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufﬁcient,\nwhen required to depend on his affection for her —for a woman who\nhad already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural\nas abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.",
    "Brother-in-law of\nWickham!",
    "Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.",
    "He\nhad, to be sure, done much.",
    "She was ashamed to think how much.",
    "But\nhe had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordi-\nnary stretch of belief.",
    "It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\nwrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and\nthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she\ncould, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist\nhis endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially\nconcerned.",
    "It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were\nunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return.",
    "They\n227\nowed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him.",
    "Oh!",
    "how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had\never encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards\nhim.",
    "For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.",
    "Proud\nthat in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the\nbetter of himself.",
    "She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again\nand again.",
    "It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.",
    "She was even\nsensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on ﬁnding how\nsteadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection\nand conﬁdence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.",
    "She was roused from her seat, and her reﬂections, by some one’s\napproach; and before she could strike into another path, she was over-\ntaken by Wickham.",
    "“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said\nhe, as he joined her.",
    "“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow\nthat the interruption must be unwelcome.”\n“I should be sorry indeed, if it were.",
    "We were always good friends;\nand now we are better.”\n“True.",
    "Are the others coming out?”\n“I do not know.",
    "Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\nMeryton.",
    "And so, my dear sister, I ﬁnd, from our uncle and aunt, that\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.”\nShe replied in the afﬁrmative.",
    "“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too\nmuch for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.",
    "And you\nsaw the old housekeeper, I suppose?",
    "Poor Reynolds, she was always\nvery fond of me.",
    "But of course she did not mention my name to you.”\n“Yes, she did.”\n“And what did she say?”\n“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had —\nnot turned out well.",
    "At such a distance as that, you know, things are\nstrangely misrepresented.”\n“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips.",
    "Elizabeth hoped she had\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\n“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.",
    "We passed each\nother several times.",
    "I wonder what he can be doing there.”\n“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\nElizabeth.",
    "“It must be something particular, to take him there at this\ntime of year.”\n“Undoubtedly.",
    "Did you see him while you were at Lambton?",
    "I\n228\nthought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.”\n“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\n“And do you like her?”\n“Very much.”\n“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\nthis year or two.",
    "When I last saw her, she was not very promising.",
    "I\nam very glad you liked her.",
    "I hope she will turn out well.”\n“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\n“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\n“I do not recollect that we did.”\n“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.",
    "A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House!",
    "It would have\nsuited me in every respect.”\n“How should you have liked making sermons?”\n“Exceedingly well.",
    "I should have considered it as part of my duty,\nand the exertion would soon have been nothing.",
    "One ought not to\nrepine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!",
    "The\nquiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas\nof happiness!",
    "But it was not to be.",
    "Did you ever hear Darcy mention\nthe circumstance, when you were in Kent?”\n“I have heard from authority, which I thought as good , that it was\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”\n“You have.",
    "Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the\nﬁrst, you may remember.”\n“Ididhear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was\nnot so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\nhad been compromised accordingly.”\n“You did!",
    "and it was not wholly without foundation.",
    "You may\nremember what I told you on that point, when ﬁrst we talked of it.”\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked\nfast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke\nhim, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:\n“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.",
    "Do not\nlet us quarrel about the past.",
    "In future, I hope we shall be always of\none mind.”\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,\nthough he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.",
    "229\nChapter 53\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisﬁed with this conversation that\nhe never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Eliza-\nbeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to ﬁnd that\nshe had said enough to keep him quiet.",
    "The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\nwas forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no\nmeans entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was\nlikely to continue at least a twelvemonth.",
    "“Oh!",
    "my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\n“Oh, lord!",
    "I don’t know.",
    "Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\n“Write to me very often, my dear.”\n“As often as I can.",
    "But you know married women have never much\ntime for writing.",
    "My sisters may write to me.",
    "They will have nothing\nelse to do.”\nMr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s.",
    "He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.",
    "“He is as ﬁne a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\nthe house, “as ever I saw.",
    "He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to\nus all.",
    "I am prodigiously proud of him.",
    "I defy even Sir William Lucas\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several\ndays.",
    "“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting\nwith one’s friends.",
    "One seems so forlorn without them.”\n“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daugh-\nter,” said Elizabeth.",
    "“It must make you better satisﬁed that your other\nfour are single.”\n“It is no such thing.",
    "Lydia does not leave me because she is married,\nbut only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off.",
    "If\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was\nshortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope,\nby an article of news which then began to be in circulation.",
    "The house-\nkeeper at Netherﬁeld had received orders to prepare for the arrival of\nher master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for\nseveral weeks.",
    "Mrs. Bennet was quite in the ﬁdgets.",
    "She looked at Jane,\nand smiled and shook her head by turns.",
    "“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\nPhillips ﬁrst brought her the news).",
    "“Well, so much the better.",
    "Not that\n230\nI care about it, though.",
    "He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure\nInever want to see him again.",
    "But, however, he is very welcome to\ncome to Netherﬁeld, if he likes it.",
    "And who knows what mayhappen?",
    "But that is nothing to us.",
    "You know, sister, we agreed long ago never\nto mention a word about it.",
    "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”\n“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was\nin Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on\npurpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.",
    "He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.",
    "She was going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in\nsome meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just\nﬁt to be killed.”\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without chang-\ning colour.",
    "It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:\n“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the\npresent report; and I know I appeared distressed.",
    "But don’t imagine it\nwas from any silly cause.",
    "I was only confused for the moment, because\nI felt that I should be looked at.",
    "I do assure you that the news does not\naffect me either with pleasure or pain.",
    "I am glad of one thing, that he\ncomes alone; because we shall see the less of him.",
    "Not that I am afraid\nofmyself , but I dread other people’s remarks.”\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it.",
    "Had she not seen him\nin Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there\nwith no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought\nhim partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of\nhis coming there with his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to\ncome without it.",
    "“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot\ncome to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this\nspeculation!",
    "I willleave him to himself.”\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\nfeelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive\nthat her spirits were affected by it.",
    "They were more disturbed, more\nunequal, than she had often seen them.",
    "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\nparents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.",
    "“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet,\n“you will wait on him of course.”\n“No, no.",
    "You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if\nI went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.",
    "But it ended\n231\nin nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an at-\ntention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his return-\ning to Netherﬁeld.",
    "“ ’Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he.",
    "“If he wants our society, let\nhim seek it.",
    "He knows where we live.",
    "I will not spend my hours in\nrunning after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\nagain.”\n“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not\nwait on him.",
    "But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine\nhere, I am determined.",
    "We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings\nsoon.",
    "That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room\nat table for him.”\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her hus-\nband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neigh-\nbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did.",
    "As the day of his arrival drew near:\n“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister.",
    "“It\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.",
    "My mother means\nwell; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from\nwhat she says.",
    "Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherﬁeld is over!”\n“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth;\n“but it is wholly out of my power.",
    "You must feel it; and the usual\nsatisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because\nyou have always so much.”\nMr. Bingley arrived.",
    "Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of ser-\nvants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of\nanxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could.",
    "She\ncounted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be\nsent; hopeless of seeing him before.",
    "But on the third morning after his\narrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.",
    "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.",
    "Jane res-\nolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother,\nwent to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and\nsat down again by her sister.",
    "“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it\nbe?”\n“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\nknow.”\n232\n“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\nhim before.",
    "Mr. what’s-his-name.",
    "That tall, proud man.”\n“Good gracious!",
    "Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow.",
    "Well, any friend\nof Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.”\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.",
    "She knew but\nlittle of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkward-\nness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the ﬁrst time\nafter receiving his explanatory letter.",
    "Both sisters were uncomfortable\nenough.",
    "Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\nmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to\nbe civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by\neither of them.",
    "But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could\nnot be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to\nshew Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment\ntowards him.",
    "To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had\nrefused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more\nextensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family\nwere indebted for the ﬁrst of beneﬁts, and whom she regarded her-\nself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and\njust as what Jane felt for Bingley.",
    "Her astonishment at his coming—at\nhis coming to Netherﬁeld, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her\nagain, was almost equal to what she had known on ﬁrst witnessing his\naltered behaviour in Derbyshire.",
    "The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half\na minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre\nto her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\nwishes must still be unshaken.",
    "But she would not be secure.",
    "“Let me ﬁrst see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\nenough for expectation.”\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without dar-\ning to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face\nof her sister as the servant was approaching the door.",
    "Jane looked a\nlittle paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.",
    "On the gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received\nthem with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally\nfree from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complai-\nsance.",
    "Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat\ndown again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often com-\nmand.",
    "She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.",
    "He looked serious,\n233\nas usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hert-\nfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.",
    "But, perhaps he\ncould not in her mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle\nand aunt.",
    "It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.",
    "Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short pe-\nriod saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.",
    "He was received\nby Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters\nashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious\npoliteness of her curtsey and address to his friend.",
    "Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter\nthe preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,\nwas hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied.",
    "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a ques-\ntion which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any-\nthing.",
    "He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his\nsilence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.",
    "There he had talked to\nher friends, when he could not to herself.",
    "But now several minutes\nelapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasion-\nally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his\nface, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently\non no object but the ground.",
    "More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to\nplease, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.",
    "She was dis-\nappointed, and angry with herself for being so.",
    "“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she.",
    "“Yet why did he\ncome?”\nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;\nand to him she had hardly courage to speak.",
    "She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.",
    "“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs.\nBennet.",
    "He readily agreed to it.",
    "“I began to be afraid you would never come back again.",
    "People\ndidsay you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, how-\never, I hope it is not true.",
    "A great many changes have happened in\nthe neighbourhood, since you went away.",
    "Miss Lucas is married and\nsettled.",
    "And one of my own daughters.",
    "I suppose you have heard of\nit; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.",
    "It was in The Times\nand The Courier , I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.",
    "It\nwas only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham, Esq.",
    "to Miss Lydia Bennet,’\nwithout there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she\n234\nlived, or anything.",
    "It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and\nI wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.",
    "Did\nyou see it?”\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.",
    "Eliza-\nbeth dared not lift up her eyes.",
    "How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she\ncould not tell.",
    "“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well mar-\nried,” continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is\nvery hard to have her taken such a way from me.",
    "They are gone down\nto Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to\nstay I do not know how long.",
    "His regiment is there; for I suppose you\nhave heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the\nregulars.",
    "Thank Heaven!",
    "he has some friends, though perhaps not so\nmany as he deserves.”\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\nmisery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.",
    "It drew from her,\nhowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectu-\nally done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any\nstay in the country at present.",
    "A few weeks, he believed.",
    "“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her\nmother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on\nMr. Bennet’s manor.",
    "I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you,\nand will save all the best of the covies for you.”\nElizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such ofﬁcious at-\ntention!",
    "Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had ﬂattered\nthem a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening\nto the same vexatious conclusion.",
    "At that instant, she felt that years of\nhappiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such\npainful confusion.",
    "“The ﬁrst wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to\nbe in company with either of them.",
    "Their society can afford no pleasure\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this!",
    "Let me never see either\none or the other again!”\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no com-\npensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\nhow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\nformer lover.",
    "When ﬁrst he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\nbut every ﬁve minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.",
    "He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured,\nand as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.",
    "Jane was anxious that no\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\n235\nthat she talked as much as ever.",
    "But her mind was so busily engaged,\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.",
    "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\nher intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\nLongbourn in a few days time.",
    "“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for\nwhen you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family\ndinner with us, as soon as you returned.",
    "I have not forgot, you see;\nand I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come\nback and keep your engagement.”\nBingley looked a little silly at this reﬂection, and said something\nof his concern at having been prevented by business.",
    "They then went\naway.",
    "Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a\nman on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite\nand pride of one who had ten thousand a year.",
    "Chapter 54\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her\nspirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those sub-\njects that must deaden them more.",
    "Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished\nand vexed her.",
    "“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\n“did he come at all?”\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.",
    "“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,\nwhen he was in town; and why not to me?",
    "If he fears me, why come\nhither?",
    "If he no longer cares for me, why silent?",
    "Teasing, teasing, man!",
    "I will think no more about him.”\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the ap-\nproach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed\nher better satisﬁed with their visitors, than Elizabeth.",
    "“Now,” said she, “that this ﬁrst meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.",
    "I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his\ncoming.",
    "I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.",
    "It will then be publicly\nseen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent ac-\nquaintance.”\n236\n“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly.",
    "“Oh,\nJane, take care.”\n“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\nnow?”\n“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in\nlove with you as ever.”\n* * * * *\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet,\nin the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which\nthe good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s\nvisit, had revived.",
    "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and\nthe two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punc-\ntuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.",
    "When they repaired\nto the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley\nwould take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged\nto him, by her sister.",
    "Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas,\nforbore to invite him to sit by herself.",
    "On entering the room, he seemed\nto hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile:\nit was decided.",
    "He placed himself by her.",
    "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.",
    "He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his\neyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-\nlaughing alarm.",
    "His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\nshowed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than for-\nmerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happi-\nness, and his own, would be speedily secured.",
    "Though she dared not\ndepend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observ-\ning his behaviour.",
    "It gave her all the animation that her spirits could\nboast; for she was in no cheerful humour.",
    "Mr. Darcy was almost as far\nfrom her as the table could divide them.",
    "He was on one side of her\nmother.",
    "She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to\neither, or make either appear to advantage.",
    "She was not near enough to\nhear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke\nto each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever\nthey did.",
    "Her mother’s ungraciousness, made the sense of what they\nowed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she would, at times,\n237\nhave given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was\nneither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.",
    "She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\nof bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass\naway without enabling them to enter into something more of conver-\nsation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.",
    "Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room,\nbefore the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that\nalmost made her uncivil.",
    "She looked forward to their entrance as the\npoint on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.",
    "“If he does not come to me, then,” said she, “I shall give him up for\never.”\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would\nhave answered her hopes; but, alas!",
    "the ladies had crowded round the\ntable, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out\nthe coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy\nnear her which would admit of a chair.",
    "And on the gentlemen’s ap-\nproaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in\na whisper:\n“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined.",
    "We want none\nof them; do we?”\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room.",
    "She followed\nhim with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely\npatience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged\nagainst herself for being so silly!",
    "“A man who has once been refused!",
    "How could I ever be foolish\nenough to expect a renewal of his love?",
    "Is there one among the sex,\nwho would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to\nthe same woman?",
    "There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee\ncup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\n“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\n“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”\n“And quite alone?",
    "Have all her friends left her?”\n“Mrs.",
    "Annesley is with her.",
    "The others have been gone on to Scar-\nborough, these three weeks.”\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success.",
    "He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.",
    "When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the\n238\nladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,\nwhen all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party.",
    "She now lost every expectation of pleasure.",
    "They were conﬁned for the evening at different tables, and she had\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her\nside of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.",
    "Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherﬁeld gentlemen\nto supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.",
    "“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What\nsay you to the day?",
    "I think every thing has passed off uncommonly\nwell, I assure you.",
    "The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.",
    "The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said they never\nsaw so fat a haunch.",
    "The soup was ﬁfty times better than what we had\nat the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the\npartridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or\nthree French cooks at least.",
    "And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in\ngreater beauty.",
    "Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did\nnot.",
    "And what do you think she said besides?",
    "‘Ah!",
    "Mrs. Bennet, we\nshall have her at Netherﬁeld at last.’ She did indeed.",
    "I do think Mrs.\nLong is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty\nbehaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough\nof Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him\nat last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a\nhappy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disap-\npointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his propos-\nals.",
    "“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.",
    "“The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.",
    "I\nhope we may often meet again.”\nElizabeth smiled.",
    "“Lizzy, you must not do so.",
    "You must not suspect me.",
    "It mortiﬁes\nme.",
    "I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.",
    "I\nam perfectly satisﬁed, from what his manners now are, that he never\nhad any design of engaging my affection.",
    "It is only that he is blessed\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\npleasing, than any other man.”\n“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and\n239\nare provoking me to it every moment.”\n“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”\n“And how impossible in others!”\n“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?”\n“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.",
    "We all\nlove to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.",
    "Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your\nconﬁdante.”\nChapter 55\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.",
    "His\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\nten days time.",
    "He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\ngood spirits.",
    "Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with\nmany expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.",
    "“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc.",
    "etc.",
    "; and if she\nwould give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on\nthem.",
    "“Can you come to-morrow?”\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation\nwas accepted with alacrity.",
    "He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none\nof them dressed.",
    "In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her\ndressing gown, and with her hair half ﬁnished, crying out:\n“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.",
    "He is come—Mr.",
    "Bing-\nley is come.",
    "He is, indeed.",
    "Make haste, make haste.",
    "Here, Sarah, come\nto Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.",
    "Never\nmind Miss Lizzy’s hair.”\n“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say\nKitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour\nago.”\n“Oh!",
    "hang Kitty!",
    "what has she to do with it?",
    "Come be quick, be\nquick!",
    "Where is your sash, my dear?”\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\ngo down without one of her sisters.",
    "The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\nevening.",
    "After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom,\n240\nand Mary went up stairs to her instrument.",
    "Two obstacles of the ﬁve\nbeing thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth\nand Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression\non them.",
    "Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,\nshe very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma?",
    "What do you\nkeep winking at me for?",
    "What am I to do?”\n“Nothing child, nothing.",
    "I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\nﬁve minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to\nspeak to you,” took her out of the room.",
    "Jane instantly gave a look\nat Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her\nentreaty that shewould not give in to it.",
    "In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet\nhalf-opened the door and called out:\n“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\nElizabeth was forced to go.",
    "“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her\nmother, as soon as she was in the hall.",
    "“Kitty and I are going upstairs\nto sit in my dressing-room.”\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.",
    "Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual.",
    "Bingley was\nevery thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her\ndaughter.",
    "His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable ad-\ndition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged ofﬁcious-\nness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance\nand command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.",
    "He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\naway, an engagement was formed, chieﬂy through his own and Mrs.\nBennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her hus-\nband.",
    "After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.",
    "Not a word\npassed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to\nbed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless\nMr. Darcy returned within the stated time.",
    "Seriously, however, she\nfelt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that\ngentleman’s concurrence.",
    "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\nspent the morning together, as had been agreed on.",
    "The latter was\nmuch more agreeable than his companion expected.",
    "There was noth-\ning of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule,\n241\nor disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less\neccentric, than the other had ever seen him.",
    "Bingley of course returned\nwith him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was\nagain at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.",
    "Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for\nthat purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down\nto cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.",
    "But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was ﬁn-\nished, she saw, to her inﬁnite surprise, there was reason to fear that\nher mother had been too ingenious for her.",
    "On opening the door, she\nperceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if\nengaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the\nfaces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\nother, would have told it all.",
    "Their situation was awkward enough; but\nher’s she thought was still worse.",
    "Not a syllable was uttered by either;\nand Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley,\nwho as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering\na few words to her sister, ran out of the room.",
    "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where conﬁdence\nwould give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with\nthe liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.",
    "“ ’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much.",
    "I do not deserve it.",
    "Oh!",
    "why is not everybody as happy?”\nElizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,\na delight, which words could but poorly express.",
    "Every sentence of\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.",
    "But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said\nfor the present.",
    "“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried.",
    "“I would not on any\naccount triﬂe with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\nfrom anyone but myself.",
    "He is gone to my father already.",
    "Oh!",
    "Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily!",
    "how shall I bear so much happiness!”\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken\nup the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.",
    "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and\nease with which an affair was ﬁnally settled, that had given them so\nmany previous months of suspense and vexation.",
    "“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious circum-\nspection!",
    "of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance!",
    "the happiest,\nwisest, most reasonable end!”\n242\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with\nher father had been short and to the purpose.",
    "“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.",
    "“With my mother up stairs.",
    "She will be down in a moment, I dare\nsay.”\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\nwishes and affection of a sister.",
    "Elizabeth honestly and heartily ex-\npressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.",
    "They shook\nhands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she\nhad to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s\nperfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed\nall his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they\nhad for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposi-\ntion of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her\nand himself.",
    "It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction\nof Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face,\nas made her look handsomer than ever.",
    "Kitty simpered and smiled,\nand hoped her turn was coming soon.",
    "Mrs. Bennet could not give her\nconsent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her\nfeelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour;\nand when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner\nplainly showed how really happy he was.",
    "Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visi-\ntor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned\nto his daughter, and said:\n“Jane, I congratulate you.",
    "You will be a very happy woman.”\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\ngoodness.",
    "“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\nthinking you will be so happily settled.",
    "I have not a doubt of your\ndoing very well together.",
    "Your tempers are by no means unlike.",
    "You\nare each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\nalways exceed your income.”\n“I hope not so.",
    "Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\nwould be unpardonable in me.”\n“Exceed their income!",
    "My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what\nare you talking of?",
    "Why, he has four or ﬁve thousand a year, and very\nlikely more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh!",
    "my dear, dear Jane,\nI am so happy!",
    "I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night.",
    "I knew\n243\nhow it would be.",
    "I always said it must be so, at last.",
    "I was sure you\ncould not be so beautiful for nothing!",
    "I remember, as soon as ever I saw\nhim, when he ﬁrst came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how\nlikely it was that you should come together.",
    "Oh!",
    "he is the handsomest\nyoung man that ever was seen!”\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.",
    "Jane was beyond competi-\ntion her favourite child.",
    "At that moment, she cared for no other.",
    "Her\nyounger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of hap-\npiness which she might in future be able to dispense.",
    "Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherﬁeld; and Kitty\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.",
    "Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Long-\nbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till\nafter supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not\nbe enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he\nthought himself obliged to accept.",
    "Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister;\nfor while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone\nelse; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those\nhours of separation that must sometimes occur.",
    "In the absence of Jane,\nhe always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking\nof her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same\nmeans of relief.",
    "“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me\nthat he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!",
    "I had not\nbelieved it possible.”\n“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth.",
    "“But how did he account\nfor it?”\n“It must have been his sister’s doing.",
    "They were certainly no\nfriends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since\nhe might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.",
    "But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with\nme, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms\nagain; though we can never be what we once were to each other.”\n“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\nheard you utter.",
    "Good girl!",
    "It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\n“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last No-\nvember, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of mybeing\nindifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”\n“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\n244\nmodesty.”\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his difﬁdence,\nand the little value he put on his own good qualities.",
    "Elizabeth was\npleased to ﬁnd that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend;\nfor, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the\nworld, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her\nagainst him.",
    "“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried\nJane.",
    "“Oh!",
    "Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\nabove them all!",
    "If I could but see youas happy!",
    "If there were but such\nanother man for you!”\n“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy\nas you.",
    "Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have\nyour happiness.",
    "No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have\nvery good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long\na secret.",
    "Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,\nand she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.",
    "The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in\nthe world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had ﬁrst run\naway, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.",
    "Chapter 56\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane\nhad been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting to-\ngether in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the\nwindow, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and\nfour driving up the lawn.",
    "It was too early in the morning for visitors,\nand besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neigh-\nbours.",
    "The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of\nthe servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.",
    "As it was certain,\nhowever, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on\nMiss Bennet to avoid the conﬁnement of such an intrusion, and walk\naway with him into the shrubbery.",
    "They both set off, and the conjec-\ntures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,\ntill the door was thrown open and their visitor entered.",
    "It was Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh.",
    "They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their aston-\n245\nishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet\nand Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to\nwhat Elizabeth felt.",
    "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\nmade no other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination\nof the head, and sat down without saying a word.",
    "Elizabeth had men-\ntioned her name to her mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though no\nrequest of introduction had been made.",
    "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though ﬂattered by having a guest of\nsuch high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.",
    "After\nsitting for a moment in silence, she said very stifﬂy to Elizabeth,\n“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.",
    "That lady, I suppose, is your\nmother.”\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.",
    "“And thatI suppose is one of your sisters.”\n“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady\nCatherine.",
    "“She is my youngest girl but one.",
    "My youngest of all is\nlately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walk-\ning with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the\nfamily.”\n“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a\nshort silence.",
    "“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\nassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\n“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\nsummer; the windows are full west.”\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and\nthen added:\n“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left\nMr. and Mrs. Collins well.”\n“Yes, very well.",
    "I saw them the night before last.”\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her\nfrom Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.",
    "But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.",
    "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\nrefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\ndeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,\n“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilder-\nness on one side of your lawn.",
    "I should be glad to take a turn in it, if\nyou will favour me with your company.”\n246\n“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the\ndifferent walks.",
    "I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her para-\nsol, attended her noble guest downstairs.",
    "As they passed through\nthe hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be de-\ncent looking rooms, walked on.",
    "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it.",
    "They proceeded in silence along the gravel\nwalk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no ef-\nfort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually\ninsolent and disagreeable.",
    "“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she\nlooked in her face.",
    "As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\nfollowing manner:—\n“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of\nmy journey hither.",
    "Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell\nyou why I come.”\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.",
    "“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.",
    "I have not been at all able to\naccount for the honour of seeing you here.”\n“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought\nto know, that I am not to be triﬂed with.",
    "But however insincere you\nmay choose to be, you shall not ﬁnd meso.",
    "My character has ever\nbeen celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.",
    "A report of a most\nalarming nature reached me two days ago.",
    "I was told that not only\nyour sister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be\nsoon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.",
    "Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not\ninjure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly\nresolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments\nknown to you.”\n“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colour-\ning with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of\ncoming so far.",
    "What could your ladyship propose by it?”\n“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contra-\ndicted.”\n“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Eliza-\n247\nbeth coolly, “will be rather a conﬁrmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.”\n“If!",
    "Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?",
    "Has it not been indus-\ntriously circulated by yourselves?",
    "Do you not know that such a report\nis spread abroad?”\n“I never heard that it was.”\n“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”\n“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.",
    "You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”\n“This is not to be borne.",
    "Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisﬁed.",
    "Has\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\n“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\n“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\nreason.",
    "But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.",
    "You may have drawn him in.”\n“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\n“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?",
    "I have not been accustomed\nto such language as this.",
    "I am almost the nearest relation he has in the\nworld, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\n“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as\nthis, ever induce me to be explicit.”\n“Let me be rightly understood.",
    "This match, to which you have the\npresumption to aspire, can never take place.",
    "No, never.",
    "Mr. Darcy is\nengaged to my daughter.",
    "Now what have you to say?”\n“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he\nwill make an offer to me.”\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\n“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.",
    "From their in-\nfancy, they have been intended for each other.",
    "It was the favourite wish\nofhismother, as well as of her’s.",
    "While in their cradles, we planned the\nunion: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\nbe accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman\nof inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\nthe family!",
    "Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?",
    "To his\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh?",
    "Are you lost to every feeling\nof propriety and delicacy?",
    "Have you not heard me say that from his\nearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\n“Yes, and I had heard it before.",
    "But what is that to me?",
    "If there is\nno other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\nkept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\n248\nMiss de Bourgh.",
    "You both did as much as you could in planning the\nmarriage.",
    "Its completion depended on others.",
    "If Mr. Darcy is neither\nby honour nor inclination conﬁned to his cousin, why is not he to make\nanother choice?",
    "And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\n“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.",
    "Yes,\nMiss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family\nor friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.",
    "You will\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.",
    "Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be men-\ntioned by any of us.”\n“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth.",
    "“But the wife of\nMr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness neces-\nsarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have\nno cause to repine.”\n“Obstinate, headstrong girl!",
    "I am ashamed of you!",
    "Is this your grat-\nitude for my attentions to you last spring?",
    "Is nothing due to me on that\nscore?",
    "Let us sit down.",
    "You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will\nI be dissuaded from it.",
    "I have not been used to submit to any person’s\nwhims.",
    "I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”\n“That will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;\nbut it will have no effect on me.”\n“I will not be interrupted.",
    "Hear me in silence.",
    "My daughter and\nmy nephew are formed for each other.",
    "They are descended, on the\nmaternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from re-\nspectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families.",
    "Their\nfortune on both sides is splendid.",
    "They are destined for each other by\nthe voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to\ndivide them?",
    "The upstart pretensions of a young woman without fam-\nily, connections, or fortune.",
    "Is this to be endured!",
    "But it must not, shall\nnot be.",
    "If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to\nquit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\n“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting\nthat sphere.",
    "He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we\nare equal.”\n“True.",
    "You area gentleman’s daughter.",
    "But who was your mother?",
    "Who are your uncles and aunts?",
    "Do not imagine me ignorant of their\ncondition.”\n“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your\nnephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.”\n“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”\n249\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\nmoment’s deliberation:\n“I am not.”\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.",
    "“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engage-\nment?”\n“I will make no promise of the kind.”\n“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.",
    "I expected to ﬁnd a\nmore reasonable young woman.",
    "But do not deceive yourself into a\nbelief that I will ever recede.",
    "I shall not go away till you have given me\nthe assurance I require.”\n“And I certainly never shall give it.",
    "I am not to be intimidated\ninto anything so wholly unreasonable.",
    "Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy\nto marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for\npromise make their marriage at all more probable?",
    "Supposing him\nto be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him\nwish to bestow it on his cousin?",
    "Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that\nthe arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary ap-\nplication have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.",
    "You\nhave widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on\nby such persuasions as these.",
    "How far your nephew might approve of\nyour interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no\nright to concern yourself in mine.",
    "I must beg, therefore, to be impor-\ntuned no farther on the subject.”\n“Not so hasty, if you please.",
    "I have by no means done.",
    "To all the\nobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add.",
    "I am no\nstranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous elope-\nment.",
    "I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a patched-\nup business, at the expence of your father and uncles.",
    "And is such a\ngirl to be my nephew’s sister?",
    "Is her husband, is the son of his late fa-\nther’s steward, to be his brother?",
    "Heaven and earth!—of what are you\nthinking?",
    "Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\n“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully an-\nswered.",
    "“You have insulted me in every possible method.",
    "I must beg\nto return to the house.”\nAnd she rose as she spoke.",
    "Lady Catherine rose also, and they\nturned back.",
    "Her ladyship was highly incensed.",
    "“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!",
    "Unfeeling, selﬁsh girl!",
    "Do you not consider that a connection with you\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\n250\n“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say.",
    "You know my sen-\ntiments.”\n“You are then resolved to have him?”\n“I have said no such thing.",
    "I am only resolved to act in that man-\nner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\nreference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”\n“It is well.",
    "You refuse, then, to oblige me.",
    "You refuse to obey the\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude.",
    "You are determined to ruin him\nin the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the\nworld.”\n“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have\nany possible claim on me, in the present instance.",
    "No principle of either\nwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.",
    "And with regard\nto the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the\nformer were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one mo-\nment’s concern—and the world in general would have too much sense\nto join in the scorn.”\n“And this is your real opinion!",
    "This is your ﬁnal resolve!",
    "Very well.",
    "I shall now know how to act.",
    "Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\nambition will ever be gratiﬁed.",
    "I came to try you.",
    "I hoped to ﬁnd you\nreasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door\nof the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no\nleave of you, Miss Bennet.",
    "I send no compliments to your mother.",
    "You\ndeserve no such attention.",
    "I am most seriously displeased.”\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\nladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.",
    "She\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.",
    "Her mother\nimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.",
    "“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”\n“She is a very ﬁne-looking woman!",
    "and her calling here was prodi-\ngiously civil!",
    "for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were\nwell.",
    "She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you.",
    "I suppose she had\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to ac-\nknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.",
    "251\nChapter 57\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\nElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many\nhours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.",
    "Lady Catherine, it ap-\npeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for\nthe sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\nDarcy.",
    "It was a rational scheme, to be sure!",
    "but from what the report\nof their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imag-\nine; till she recollected that hisbeing the intimate friend of Bingley, and\nherbeing the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expecta-\ntion of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the\nidea.",
    "She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sis-\nter must bring them more frequently together.",
    "And her neighbours\nat Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady Catherine), had\nonly set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had\nlooked forward to as possible at some future time.",
    "In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not\nhelp feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her per-\nsisting in this interference.",
    "From what she had said of her resolution\nto prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must med-\nitate an application to her nephew; and how hemight take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\nnot pronounce.",
    "She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than shecould do; and it\nwas certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one,\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt\nwould address him on his weakest side.",
    "With his notions of dignity,\nhe would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had\nappeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid\nreasoning.",
    "If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which\nhad often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation\nmight settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as\ndignity unblemished could make him.",
    "In that case he would return no\nmore.",
    "Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his\nengagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherﬁeld must give way.",
    "“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come\nto his friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to un-\n252\nderstand it.",
    "I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\nconstancy.",
    "If he is satisﬁed with only regretting me, when he might\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\nat all.”\n* * * * *\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor\nhad been, was very great; but they obligingly satisﬁed it, with the same\nkind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and\nElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.",
    "The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by\nher father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.",
    "“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to\ntell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\nconnected with the letter he held.",
    "It suddenly struck her that it might\nbe from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the con-\nsequent explanations.",
    "She followed her father to the ﬁre place, and they both sat down.",
    "He then said,\n“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me ex-\nceedingly.",
    "As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\ncontents.",
    "I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink\nof matrimony.",
    "Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and\nshe was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\nherself; when her father continued:\n“You look conscious.",
    "Young ladies have great penetration in such\nmatters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover\nthe name of your admirer.",
    "This letter is from Mr. Collins.”\n“From Mr. Collins!",
    "and what can hehave to say?”\n“Something very much to the purpose of course.",
    "He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossip-\ning Lucases.",
    "I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what\nhe says on that point.",
    "What relates to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having\nthus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and my-\nself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject\nof another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority.",
    "253\nYour daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of\nBennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of\nher fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\npersonages in this land.’\n“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?” ‘This young\ngentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\nmortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and exten-\nsive patronage.",
    "Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my\ncousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a pre-\ncipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you\nwill be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’\n“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?",
    "But now it\ncomes out:\n“ ‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows.",
    "We have reason to\nimagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the\nmatch with a friendly eye.’\n“Mr.",
    "Darcy , you see, is the man!",
    "Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised\nyou.",
    "Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the\ncircle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\neffectually to what they related?",
    "Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in\nhis life!",
    "It is admirable!”\nElizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only\nforce one most reluctant smile.",
    "Never had his wit been directed in a\nmanner so little agreeable to her.",
    "“Are you not diverted?”\n“Oh!",
    "yes.",
    "Pray read on.”\n“ ‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship\nlast night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed\nwhat she felt on the occasion; when it become apparent, that on the\nscore of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would\nnever give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.",
    "I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my\ncousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are\nabout, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been prop-\nerly sanctioned.’ Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that\nmy cousin Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am\nonly concerned that their living together before the marriage took place\nshould be so generally known.",
    "I must not, however, neglect the duties\nof my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that\nyou received the young couple into your house as soon as they were\n254\nmarried.",
    "It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of\nLongbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.",
    "You ought cer-\ntainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your\nsight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ That is his\nnotion of Christian forgiveness!",
    "The rest of his letter is only about his\ndear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.",
    "But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.",
    "You are not going to be\nmissish , I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.",
    "For what\ndo we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in\nour turn?”\n“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted.",
    "But it is so\nstrange!”\n“Yes— thatis what makes it amusing.",
    "Had they ﬁxed on any other\nman it would have been nothing; but hisperfect indifference, and your\npointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!",
    "Much as I abominate\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any con-\nsideration.",
    "Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him\nthe preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.",
    "And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Cather-\nine about this report?",
    "Did she call to refuse her consent?”\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it\nhad been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by\nhis repeating it.",
    "Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\nfeelings appear what they were not.",
    "It was necessary to laugh, when\nshe would rather have cried.",
    "Her father had most cruelly mortiﬁed her,\nby what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference, and she could do nothing\nbut wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead\nof his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.",
    "Chapter 58\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady\nCatherine’s visit.",
    "The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Ben-\nnet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her\ndaughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone\nwith Jane, proposed their all walking out.",
    "It was agreed to.",
    "Mrs. Ben-\nnet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but\nthe remaining ﬁve set off together.",
    "Bingley and Jane, however, soon\n255\nallowed the others to outstrip them.",
    "They lagged behind, while Eliza-\nbeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.",
    "Very little was said\nby either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was se-\ncretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing\nthe same.",
    "They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\nupon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a gen-\neral concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.",
    "Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her\ncourage was high, she immediately said:\n“Mr.",
    "Darcy, I am a very selﬁsh creature; and, for the sake of giv-\ning relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding\nyour’s.",
    "I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kind-\nness to my poor sister.",
    "Ever since I have known it, I have been most\nanxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.",
    "Were it known\nto the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to\nexpress.”\n“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\nand emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mis-\ntaken light, have given you uneasiness.",
    "I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\nwas so little to be trusted.”\n“You must not blame my aunt.",
    "Lydia’s thoughtlessness ﬁrst be-\ntrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course,\nI could not rest till I knew the particulars.",
    "Let me thank you again\nand again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion\nwhich induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many morti-\nﬁcations, for the sake of discovering them.”\n“If you willthank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.",
    "That\nthe wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other in-\nducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.",
    "But your fam-\nilyowe me nothing.",
    "Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of\nyou.”\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.",
    "After a short\npause, her companion added, “You are too generous to triﬂe with me.",
    "If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.",
    "Myaffections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will\nsilence me on this subject for ever.”\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anx-\niety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately,\nthough not very ﬂuently, gave him to understand that her sentiments\nhad undergone so material a change, since the period to which he al-\n256\nluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present\nassurances.",
    "The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he\nhad probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occa-\nsion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be sup-\nposed to do.",
    "Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might\nhave seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over\nhis face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen,\nand he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she\nwas to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.",
    "They walked on, without knowing in what direction.",
    "There was\ntoo much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other\nobjects.",
    "She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good\nunderstanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her\nreturn through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its\nmotive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling\nemphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship’s\napprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in\nthe belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that\npromise from her nephew which she had refused to give.",
    "But, unluck-\nily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.",
    "“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed\nmyself to hope before.",
    "I knew enough of your disposition to be cer-\ntain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you\nwould have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know\nenough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.",
    "After abusing\nyou so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you\nto all your relations.”\n“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?",
    "For, though your\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my be-\nhaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof.",
    "It was\nunpardonable.",
    "I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\n“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\nevening,” said Elizabeth.",
    "“The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,\nwill be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved\nin civility.”\n“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.",
    "The recollection of what\nI then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the\nwhole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful\nto me.",
    "Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘had you be-\nhaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words.",
    "You\n257\nknow not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—\nthough it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to\nallow their justice.”\n“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\nimpression.",
    "I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\na way.”\n“I can easily believe it.",
    "You thought me then devoid of every proper\nfeeling, I am sure you did.",
    "The turn of your countenance I shall never\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\nway that would induce you to accept me.”\n“Oh!",
    "do not repeat what I then said.",
    "These recollections will not do\nat all.",
    "I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”\nDarcy mentioned his letter.",
    "“Did it,” said he, “did it soon make\nyou think better of me?",
    "Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\ncontents?”\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually\nall her former prejudices had been removed.",
    "“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it\nwas necessary.",
    "I hope you have destroyed the letter.",
    "There was one\npart especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having\nthe power of reading again.",
    "I can remember some expressions which\nmight justly make you hate me.”\n“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think\nmy opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so eas-\nily changed as that implies.”\n“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself per-\nfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.”\n“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.",
    "The\nadieu is charity itself.",
    "But think no more of the letter.",
    "The feelings\nof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so\nwidely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant cir-\ncumstance attending it ought to be forgotten.",
    "You must learn some of\nmy philosophy.",
    "Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\npleasure.”\n“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.",
    "Your ret-\nrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of in-\nnocence.",
    "But with me, it is not so.",
    "Painful recollections will intrude\nwhich cannot, which ought not, to be repelled.",
    "I have been a selﬁsh\n258\nbeing all my life, in practice, though not in principle.",
    "As a child I was\ntaught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper.",
    "I was\ngiven good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.",
    "Un-\nfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by\nmy parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all\nthat was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught\nme to be selﬁsh and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own fam-\nily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to\nthink meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.",
    "Such\nI was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been\nbut for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!",
    "What do I not owe you!",
    "You\ntaught me a lesson, hard indeed at ﬁrst, but most advantageous.",
    "By\nyou, I was properly humbled.",
    "I came to you without a doubt of my\nreception.",
    "You showed me how insufﬁcient were all my pretensions to\nplease a woman worthy of being pleased.”\n“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\n“Indeed I had.",
    "What will you think of my vanity?",
    "I believed you to\nbe wishing, expecting my addresses.”\n“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\nyou.",
    "I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\nwrong.",
    "How you must have hated me after thatevening?”\n“Hate you!",
    "I was angry perhaps at ﬁrst, but my anger soon began\nto take a proper direction.”\n“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we\nmet at Pemberley.",
    "You blamed me for coming?”\n“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”\n“Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by\nyou.",
    "My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary polite-\nness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.”\n“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see\nthat your reproofs had been attended to.",
    "How soon any other wishes\nintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an\nhour after I had seen you.”\nHe then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of\nher disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading\nto the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\nhad arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\n259\ncomprehend.",
    "She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject\nto each, to be dwelt on farther.",
    "After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to\nknow anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches,\nthat it was time to be at home.",
    "“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder\nwhich introduced the discussion of their affairs.",
    "Darcy was delighted\nwith their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest informa-\ntion of it.",
    "“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.",
    "“Not at all.",
    "When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\n“That is to say, you had given your permission.",
    "I guessed as much.”\nAnd though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty\nmuch the case.",
    "“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.",
    "I\ntold him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\naffairs absurd and impertinent.",
    "His surprise was great.",
    "He had never\nhad the slightest suspicion.",
    "I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\nfriend.",
    "“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you\ntold him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last\nspring?”\n“From the former.",
    "I had narrowly observed her during the two vis-\nits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”\n“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction\nto him.”\n“It did.",
    "Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.",
    "His difﬁdence had\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\nhis reliance on mine made every thing easy.",
    "I was obliged to confess\none thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.",
    "I could not\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.",
    "He\nwas angry.",
    "But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he\nremained in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments.",
    "He has heartily\nforgiven me now.”\n260\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most de-\nlightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she\nchecked herself.",
    "She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed\nat, and it was rather too early to begin.",
    "In anticipating the happiness\nof Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he con-\ntinued the conversation till they reached the house.",
    "In the hall they\nparted.",
    "Chapter 59\n“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a ques-\ntion which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their\nroom, and from all the others when they sat down to table.",
    "She had\nonly to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond\nher own knowledge.",
    "She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor\nanything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.",
    "The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.",
    "The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged\nwere silent.",
    "Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness over-\nﬂows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that\nshe was happy than feltherself to be so; for, besides the immediate em-\nbarrassment, there were other evils before her.",
    "She anticipated what\nwould be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was\naware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the\nothers it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might\ndo away.",
    "At night she opened her heart to Jane.",
    "Though suspicion was very\nfar from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous\nhere.",
    "“You are joking, Lizzy.",
    "This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy!",
    "No,\nno, you shall not deceive me.",
    "I know it to be impossible.”\n“This is a wretched beginning indeed!",
    "My sole dependence was on\nyou; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.",
    "Yet,\nindeed, I am in earnest.",
    "I speak nothing but the truth.",
    "He still loves\nme, and we are engaged.”\nJane looked at her doubtingly.",
    "“Oh, Lizzy!",
    "it cannot be.",
    "I know\nhow much you dislike him.”\n“You know nothing of the matter.",
    "That is all to be forgot.",
    "Perhaps\nI did not always love him so well as I do now.",
    "But in such cases as\nthese, a good memory is unpardonable.",
    "This is the last time I shall\n261\never remember it myself.”\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement.",
    "Elizabeth again, and more\nseriously assured her of its truth.",
    "“Good Heaven!",
    "can it be really so!",
    "Yet now I must believe you,”\ncried Jane.",
    "“My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but\nare you certain?",
    "forgive the question —are you quite certain that you\ncan be happy with him?”\n“There can be no doubt of that.",
    "It is settled between us already, that\nwe are to be the happiest couple in the world.",
    "But are you pleased,\nJane?",
    "Shall you like to have such a brother?”\n“Very, very much.",
    "Nothing could give either Bingley or myself\nmore delight.",
    "But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.",
    "And\ndo you really love him quite well enough?",
    "Oh, Lizzy!",
    "do anything\nrather than marry without affection.",
    "Are you quite sure that you feel\nwhat you ought to do?”\n“Oh, yes!",
    "You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I\ntell you all.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.",
    "I am\nafraid you will be angry.”\n“My dearest sister, now beserious.",
    "I want to talk very seriously.",
    "Let\nme know every thing that I am to know, without delay.",
    "Will you tell\nme how long you have loved him?”\n“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\nbegan.",
    "But I believe I must date it from my ﬁrst seeing his beautiful\ngrounds at Pemberley.”\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\ndesired effect; and she soon satisﬁed Jane by her solemn assurances of\nattachment.",
    "When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\nfurther to wish.",
    "“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as\nmyself.",
    "I always had a value for him.",
    "Were it for nothing but his love\nof you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend\nand your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear\nto me.",
    "But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.",
    "How\nlittle did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!",
    "I owe\nall that I know of it to another, not to you.”\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.",
    "She had been unwill-\ning to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had\nmade her equally avoid the name of his friend.",
    "But now she would\nno longer conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage.",
    "All was ac-\n262\nknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.",
    "* * * * *\n“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the\nnext morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again\nwith our dear Bingley!",
    "What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be\nalways coming here?",
    "I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or\nsomething or other, and not disturb us with his company.",
    "What shall\nwe do with him?",
    "Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he\nmay not be in Bingley’s way.”\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;\nyet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such\nan epithet.",
    "As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good infor-\nmation; and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs.",
    "Bennet, have you no\nmore lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”\n“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to\nwalk to Oakham Mount this morning.",
    "It is a nice long walk, and Mr.\nDarcy has never seen the view.”\n“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am\nsure it will be too much for Kitty.",
    "Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that she\nhad rather stay at home.",
    "Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the\nview from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.",
    "As she went\nup stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:\n“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that dis-\nagreeable man all to yourself.",
    "But I hope you will not mind it: it is all\nfor Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him,\nexcept just now and then.",
    "So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.”\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should\nbe asked in the course of the evening.",
    "Elizabeth reserved to herself\nthe application for her mother’s.",
    "She could not determine how her\nmother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and\ngrandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.",
    "But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently de-\nlighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill\nadapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.\nDarcy should hear the ﬁrst raptures of her joy, than the ﬁrst vehemence\nof her disapprobation.",
    "* * * * *\n263\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she\nsaw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing\nit was extreme.",
    "She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was\ngoing to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means—\nthat she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice,\nshould be ﬁlling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her—was\na wretched reﬂection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared\nagain, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.",
    "In a\nfew minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty;\nand, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to\nyour father, he wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.",
    "Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.",
    "“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing?",
    "Are you out of your senses, to\nbe accepting this man?",
    "Have not you always hated him?”\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had\nbeen more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!",
    "It would have\nspared her from explanations and professions which it was exceed-\ningly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured\nhim, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.",
    "“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.",
    "He is rich,\nto be sure, and you may have more ﬁne clothes and ﬁne carriages than\nJane.",
    "But will they make you happy?”\n“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief\nof my indifference?”\n“None at all.",
    "We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of\nman; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.”\n“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.",
    "Indeed he has no improper pride.",
    "He is perfectly amiable.",
    "You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him\nin such terms.”\n“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent.",
    "He is the\nkind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,\nwhich he condescended to ask.",
    "I now give it to you, if you are re-\nsolved on having him.",
    "But let me advise you to think better of it.",
    "I\nknow your disposition, Lizzy.",
    "I know that you could be neither happy\nnor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you\nlooked up to him as a superior.",
    "Your lively talents would place you\nin the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.",
    "You could scarcely es-\ncape discredit and misery.",
    "My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\nyouunable to respect your partner in life.",
    "You know not what you are\nabout.”\n264\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\nand at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\nobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her esti-\nmation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his\naffection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\nmonths’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good quali-\nties, she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\nmatch.",
    "“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no\nmore to say.",
    "If this be the case, he deserves you.",
    "I could not have\nparted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.\nDarcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.",
    "He heard her with astonish-\nment.",
    "“This is an evening of wonders, indeed!",
    "And so, Darcy did every\nthing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and\ngot him his commission!",
    "So much the better.",
    "It will save me a world\nof trouble and economy.",
    "Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and\nwould have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing\ntheir own way.",
    "I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and\nstorm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\nreading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, al-\nlowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young\nmen come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”\nElizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,\nafter half an hour’s quiet reﬂection in her own room, she was able to\njoin the others with tolerable composure.",
    "Every thing was too recent\nfor gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\nanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiar-\nity would come in time.",
    "When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she fol-\nlowed her, and made the important communication.",
    "Its effect was most\nextraordinary; for on ﬁrst hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and un-\nable to utter a syllable.",
    "Nor was it under many, many minutes that she\ncould comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward\nto credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the\nshape of a lover to any of them.",
    "She began at length to recover, to ﬁdget\nabout in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.",
    "“Good gracious!",
    "Lord bless me!",
    "only think!",
    "dear me!",
    "Mr. Darcy!",
    "Who would have thought it!",
    "And is it really true?",
    "Oh!",
    "my sweetest\n265\nLizzy!",
    "how rich and how great you will be!",
    "What pin-money, what\njewels, what carriages you will have!",
    "Jane’s is nothing to it—nothing at\nall.",
    "I am so pleased—so happy.",
    "Such a charming man!—so handsome!",
    "so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy!",
    "pray apologise for my having disliked\nhim so much before.",
    "I hope he will overlook it.",
    "Dear, dear Lizzy.",
    "A\nhouse in town!",
    "Every thing that is charming!",
    "Three daughters married!",
    "Ten thousand a year!",
    "Oh, Lord!",
    "What will become of me.",
    "I shall go\ndistracted.”\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\ndoubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only\nby herself, soon went away.",
    "But before she had been three minutes in\nher own room, her mother followed her.",
    "“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else!",
    "Ten\nthousand a year, and very likely more!",
    "’Tis as good as a Lord!",
    "And a\nspecial licence.",
    "You must and shall be married by a special licence.",
    "But\nmy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,\nthat I may have it to-morrow.”\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gen-\ntleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the cer-\ntain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for.",
    "But the morrow\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.",
    "Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to\nget acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was\nrising every hour in his esteem.",
    "“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he.",
    "“Wickham, per-\nhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well\nas Jane’s.”\nChapter 60\nElizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\nDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.",
    "“How\ncould you begin?” said she.",
    "“I can comprehend your going on charm-\ningly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you\noff in the ﬁrst place?”\n“I cannot ﬁx on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words,\n266\nwhich laid the foundation.",
    "It is too long ago.",
    "I was in the middle\nbefore I knew that I hadbegun.”\n“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my\nbehaviour to youwas at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I\nnever spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.",
    "Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\n“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”\n“You may as well call it impertinence at once.",
    "It was very little less.",
    "The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of ofﬁcious atten-\ntion.",
    "You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\nand looking, and thinking for your approbation alone.",
    "I roused, and\ninterested you, because I was so unlike them.",
    "Had you not been really\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just;\nand in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assid-\nuously courted you.",
    "There—I have saved you the trouble of account-\ning for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\nreasonable.",
    "To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody\nthinks of thatwhen they fall in love.”\n“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\nshe was ill at Netherﬁeld?”\n“Dearest Jane!",
    "who could have done less for her?",
    "But make a virtue\nof it by all means.",
    "My good qualities are under your protection, and\nyou are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it be-\nlongs to me to ﬁnd occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as\noften as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made\nyou so unwilling to come to the point at last.",
    "What made you so shy of\nme, when you ﬁrst called, and afterwards dined here?",
    "Why, especially,\nwhen you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”\n“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encourage-\nment.”\n“But I was embarrassed.”\n“And so was I.”\n“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”\n“A man who had felt less, might.”\n“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\nand that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!",
    "But I wonder how\nlong you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.",
    "I wonder\nwhen you would have spoken, if I had not asked you!",
    "My resolution\nof thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.",
    "Too much , I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\n267\nsprings from a breach of promise?",
    "for I ought not to have mentioned\nthe subject.",
    "This will never do.”\n“You need not distress yourself.",
    "The moral will be perfectly fair.",
    "Lady Catherine’s unjustiﬁable endeavours to separate us were the\nmeans of removing all my doubts.",
    "I am not indebted for my present\nhappiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.",
    "I was\nnot in a humour to wait for any opening of your’s.",
    "My aunt’s intelli-\ngence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every\nthing.”\n“Lady Catherine has been of inﬁnite use, which ought to make her\nhappy, for she loves to be of use.",
    "But tell me, what did you come down\nto Netherﬁeld for?",
    "Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embar-\nrassed?",
    "or had you intended any more serious consequence?”\n“My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether\nI might ever hope to make you love me.",
    "My avowed one, or what I\navowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to\nBingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have\nsince made.”\n“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what\nis to befall her?”\n“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.",
    "But it\nought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done\ndirectly.”\n“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.",
    "But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.\nDarcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.\nGardiner’s long letter; but now, having thatto communicate which she\nknew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to ﬁnd that\nher uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and im-\nmediately wrote as follows:\n“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to\nhave done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to\nsay the truth, I was too cross to write.",
    "You supposed more than really\nexisted.",
    "But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein\nto your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible ﬂight which\nthe subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you\ncannot greatly err.",
    "You must write again very soon, and praise him a\ngreat deal more than you did in your last.",
    "I thank you, again and again,\n268\nfor not going to the Lakes.",
    "How could I be so silly as to wish it!",
    "Your\nidea of the ponies is delightful.",
    "We will go round the Park every day.",
    "I am the happiest creature in the world.",
    "Perhaps other people have\nsaid so before, but not one with such justice.",
    "I am happier even than\nJane; she only smiles, I laugh.",
    "Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the\nworld that he can spare from me.",
    "You are all to come to Pemberley at\nChristmas.",
    "Yours, etc.”\nMr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and\nstill different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in\nreply to his last.",
    "“Dear Sir ,\n“I must trouble you once more for congratulations.",
    "Elizabeth will\nsoon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.",
    "Console Lady Catherine as well as you\ncan.",
    "But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.",
    "He has more to\ngive.",
    "“Yours sincerely, etc.”\nMiss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\nmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.",
    "She wrote even\nto Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former\nprofessions of regard.",
    "Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and\nthough feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much\nkinder answer than she knew was deserved.",
    "The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar informa-\ntion, was as sincere as her brother’s in sending it.",
    "Four sides of paper\nwere insufﬁcient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\nbeing loved by her sister.",
    "Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congrat-\nulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that\nthe Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge.",
    "The reason of\nthis sudden removal was soon evident.",
    "Lady Catherine had been ren-\ndered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over.",
    "At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meet-\nings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of\nher husband.",
    "He bore it, however, with admirable calmness.",
    "He could\n269\neven listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on car-\nrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes\nof their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent compo-\nsure.",
    "If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out\nof sight.",
    "Mrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on\nhis forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood\nin too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s\ngood humour encouraged, yet, whenever she didspeak, she must be\nvulgar.",
    "Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet,\nat all likely to make her more elegant.",
    "Elizabeth did all she could to\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious\nto keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might\nconverse without mortiﬁcation; and though the uncomfortable feelings\narising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its plea-\nsure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with\ndelight to the time when they should be removed from society so little\npleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\nat Pemberley.",
    "Chapter 61\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Ben-\nnet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.",
    "With what delighted\npride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy,\nmay be guessed.",
    "I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\naccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many\nof her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\namiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps\nit was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous\nand invariably silly.",
    "Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection\nfor her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.",
    "He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least ex-\npected.",
    "Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherﬁeld only a twelvemonth.",
    "So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desir-\nable even to hiseasy temper, or heraffectionate heart.",
    "The darling wish\nof his sisters was then gratiﬁed; he bought an estate in a neighbour-\n270\ning county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every\nother source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.",
    "Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time\nwith her two elder sisters.",
    "In society so superior to what she had gener-\nally known, her improvement was great.",
    "She was not of so ungovern-\nable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the inﬂuence of Lydia’s\nexample, she became, by proper attention and management, less irri-\ntable, less ignorant, and less insipid.",
    "From the further disadvantage\nof Lydia’s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.\nWickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to\nher going.",
    "Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\nnecessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Ben-\nnet’s being quite unable to sit alone.",
    "Mary was obliged to mix more\nwith the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit;\nand as she was no longer mortiﬁed by comparisons between her sis-\nters’ beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she sub-\nmitted to the change without much reluctance.",
    "As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution\nfrom the marriage of her sisters.",
    "He bore with philosophy the con-\nviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of\nhis ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in\nspite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet\nbe prevailed on to make his fortune.",
    "The congratulatory letter which\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that,\nby his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.",
    "The\nletter was to this effect:\n“My dear Lizzy ,\n“I wish you joy.",
    "If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear\nWickham, you must be very happy.",
    "It is a great comfort to have you\nso rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think\nof us.",
    "I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and\nI do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without\nsome help.",
    "Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year;\nbut however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.",
    "“Yours, etc.”\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeav-\noured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of\n271\nthe kind.",
    "Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the\npractice of what might be called economy in her own private expences,\nshe frequently sent them.",
    "It had always been evident to her that such\nan income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant\nin their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufﬁcient to\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane\nor herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance to-\nwards discharging their bills.",
    "Their manner of living, even when the\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\nextreme.",
    "They were always moving from place to place in quest of a\ncheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.",
    "His af-\nfection for her soon sunk into indifference; her’s lasted a little longer;\nand in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims\nto reputation which her marriage had given her.",
    "Though Darcy could never receive himat Pemberley, yet, for Eliza-\nbeth’s sake, he assisted him further in his profession.",
    "Lydia was occa-\nsionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself\nin London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently\nstaid so long, that even Bingley’s good humour was overcome, and he\nproceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.",
    "Miss Bingley was very deeply mortiﬁed by Darcy’s marriage; but as\nshe thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\ndropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\nattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to\nElizabeth.",
    "Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the\nsisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.",
    "They were able to\nlove each other even as well as they intended.",
    "Georgiana had the high-\nest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at ﬁrst she often listened\nwith an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, man-\nner of talking to her brother.",
    "He, who had always inspired in herself\na respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object\nof open pleasantry.",
    "Her mind received knowledge which had never\nbefore fallen in her way.",
    "By Elizabeth’s instructions, she began to com-\nprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a\nbrother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger\nthan himself.",
    "Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\nnephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her char-\nacter in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she\nsent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for\n272\nsome time all intercourse was at an end.",
    "But at length, by Elizabeth’s\npersuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a\nreconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his\naunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her\ncuriosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended\nto wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods\nhad received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.",
    "With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.",
    "Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\nsensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bring-\ning her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.",
